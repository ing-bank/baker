## Introduction


Baker is a library that reduces the effort to orchestrate (micro)service-based process flows.

Developers declare the orchestration logic in a *Recipe* (process blueprint).

A *Recipe* is made out of:

- *Interactions* (functions)
- *Ingredients* (data)
- *Events*

More about these concepts [here](documentation/concepts).

A visual representation of the recipe allows product owners, architects and developers to talk the same language:
