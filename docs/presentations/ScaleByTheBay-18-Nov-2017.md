## Good to Know

---

### Short-lived vs. long-running flows

---

### State is taken care of:

- Cassandra for persistent storage
- Ingredients encrypted by default
- State recovered automatically

---

### When failure occurs:

- Baker retries technical failures with exponential backoff
- Works well with **idempotent** services
- Deal with functional failure in your recipe

---

Baker Capability Matrix:

- Investigate not one, not two, but **all business processes** in your company
- Where do you see re-use?
- Map using MoSCoW[^4] to give importance (M = 10, S = 5, C = 2, W = 1)

## Design-time

```scala
val registerIndividual = Interaction(
  name = "RegisterIndividual",
  inputIngredients = Seq(name, address),
  output = Seq(registerIndividualSuccessful, registerIndividualFailed)
)
```

```

  .withSensoryEvents(

```

## Run-time

---

```scala
//for each process instance, bake the recipe
baker.bake(processId);
//notify Baker when events occur
baker.processEvent(processId, individualInformationSubmitted.instance(name, address));
baker.processEvent(processId, termsAndConditionsAccepted.instance());

//retrieve ingredients stored in the accumulated state
assert(baker.getIngredients(processId).get("customerId").equals(customerId));
assert(baker.getIngredients(processId).get("iban").equals(iban));

//retrieve all events that have occurred
baker.events(processId)
```

**I love cooking food** and for the rest of the talk I'll be using examples from there. It's very **similar to our industry**: long hours, hard work, and delivering experiences to our customers.

Have you been woken up at 3 o'clock in the morning on a **Saturday morning** after a night of partying, having to go to the war room and resolve an application incident. I've been there. When I remember the cold of the **airconditioners**, it still **makes me shiver**.

If we are building microservices or a monolith or any type of application in general we are **serving business logic to our clients**. So no matter what, we cannot escape the **architectural discussion**. If we are not careful of how we architect our applications we end up serving a bad meal to our clients.
