# The Akka Based Runtime

## Baker.akka(config, actorSystem)

Baker provider several constructors to build a runtime to run your Recipes on. The current implementations are o
[Akka](https://akka.io/) based, one in local mode, and another in cluster mode. 

_Note: We recommend reviewing also Akka configuration._

```scala tab="Scala"
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import com.ing.baker.runtime.scaladsl.Baker
import com.typesafe.config.{Config, ConfigFactory}


val actorSystem: ActorSystem = ActorSystem("WebshopSystem")
val config: Config = ConfigFactory.load()

val baker: Baker = Baker.akka(config, actorSystem)
```

```java tab="Java"
import akka.actor.ActorSystem;
import com.ing.baker.runtime.javadsl.Baker;
import com.typesafe.config.Config;
import com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory;


ActorSystem actorSystem = ActorSystem.create("WebshopSystem");
Config config = ConfigFactory.load();

Baker baker = Baker.akka(config, actorSystem);
```

This last code snippet will build a Baker runtime and load all configuration from your default `application.conf` located 
in the resources directory. You can see more about configuration on [this section](../development-life-cycle/configure.md).

Alternatively there is a constructor that will provide the default configuration for a local mode Baker, this 
is recommended for tests.

```scala tab="Scala"

val baker: Baker = AkkaBaker.localDefault(actorSystem)

```

```java tab="Java"

Baker baker = AkkaBaker.javaLocalDefault(actorSystem);

```

### Advantages of the Cluster Mode

The capabilities gained when in cluster mode are:

* Elasticity: by adding/removing nodes to the cluster.
* Resilience: `RecipeInstances` are automatically restored in a new node when the hosting node fails. (For this you need to configure 
a distributed data store like Cassandra)
* Routing: You can fire `EventInstances` from anywhere on the cluster, and Baker will ensure that the corresponding `RecipeInstance`
receives the firing event.

_Note: To run on cluster mode you need to configure a distributed data store, we highly recommend using Cassandra._

## InteractionInstance.from(object) (Reflection API)

As part of our efforts to ease the creation of `InteractionInstances` we created this function that uses the Scala and the
Java reflection capabilities to create an `InteractionInstance` from an instance of a class.

The name of the `InteractionInstance` will be taken from the name of the implementing `interface` (Java) or `trait` (Scala) 
(it must match the name of the `Interaction` at the `Recipe`).

The interface MUST declare a public method called `apply`, and the types must match those of the expected provided ingredients.

Notice that his function might throw an exception if the instance is not correctly done (this is why in Scala the API is
named "unsafe").

```scala tab="Scala"
import com.ing.baker.runtime.scaladsl.InteractionInstance

import scala.concurrent.Future
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

sealed trait ReserveItemsOutput
case class OrderHadUnavailableItems(unavailableItems: List[String]) extends ReserveItemsOutput
case class ItemsReserved(reservedItems: List[String]) extends ReserveItemsOutput

trait ReserveItems {

  def apply(orderId: String, items: List[String]): Future[ReserveItemsOutput]
}

class ReserveItemsInstance extends ReserveItems {

  override def apply(orderId: String, items: List[String]): Future[ReserveItemsOutput] = {

    // Http call to the Warehouse service
    val response: Future[Either[List[String], List[String]]] =
    // This is mocked for the sake of the example
      Future.successful(Right(items))

    // Build an event instance that Baker understands
    response.map {
      case Left(unavailableItems) =>
        OrderHadUnavailableItems(unavailableItems)
      case Right(reservedItems) =>
        ItemsReserved(reservedItems)
    }
  }
}

val reserveItemsInstance: InteractionInstance =
  InteractionInstance.unsafeFrom(new ReserveItemsInstance)
```

``` java tab="Java"
import com.ing.baker.runtime.javadsl.InteractionInstance;
import com.ing.baker.runtime.javadsl.Interaction;

/** Java interface used for the Recipe */
public interface ReserveItems extends Interaction {

    interface ReserveItemsOutcome {}

    class OrderHadUnavailableItems implements ReserveItemsOutcome {

        public final List<String> unavailableItems;

        public OrderHadUnavailableItems(List<String> unavailableItems) {
            this.unavailableItems = unavailableItems;
        }
    }

    class ItemsReserved implements ReserveItemsOutcome {

        public final List<String> reservedItems;

        public ItemsReserved(List<String> reservedItems) {
            this.reservedItems = reservedItems;
        }
    }

    @FiresEvent(oneOf = {OrderHadUnavailableItems.class, ItemsReserved.class})
    ReserveItemsOutcome apply(@RequiresIngredient("orderId") String id, @RequiresIngredient("items") List<String> items);
}

/** Implementation of the interface used for creating an InteractionInstance */
public class ReserveItems implements JWebshopRecipe.ReserveItems {

    // The body of this method is going to be executed by the Baker runtime when the ingredients are available.
    @Override
    public ReserveItemsOutcome apply(String id, List<String> items) {
        return new ReserveItems.ItemsReserved(items);
    }
}
        
/** Create an InteractionInstance from an instance of the ReserveItems implementation */        
InteractionInstance reserveItemsInstance = InteractionInstance.from(new ReserveItems());
```

## baker.addInteractionInstance(interactionInstance)

The Baker runtime requires you to add all `InteractionInstances` before adding any related `CompiledRecipes`. This can
be done using the `baker.addInteractionInstance(interactionInstance)` or the `baker.addInteractionInstances(intance1, instance2, ...)`
APIs.

_Note: in Java the api returns a `CompletableFuture<BoxedUnit>`, this is because the API is implemented in Scala, so 
Scala's `Unit` get translated to `BoxedUnit`, but you should you ignore it and consider it as good as Java's `void`,
except it comes in a `CompletableFuture` that will help you handle async programming._

```scala tab="Scala"

val baker: Baker = AkkaBaker.localDefault(actorSystem)

val reserveItemsInstance: InteractionInstance = InteractionInstance.unsafeFrom(new ReserveItems())

val result: Future[Unit] = baker.addInteractionInstance(reserveItemsInstance)

```

```java tab="Java"

Baker baker = AkkaBaker.javaLocalDefault(actorSystem);

InteractionInstance reserveItemsInstance = InteractionInstance.from(new ReserveItems());

CompletableFuture<BoxedUnit> = baker.addInteractionInstance(reserveItemsInstance);

```

## RecipeCompiler.compile(recipe)

`Recipes` once built must be converted into a data structure called `CompiledRecipe` that lets `RecipeInstances` 
to understand, store and run your process. These can be used to create a new `RecipeInstance` from a `baker` 
runtime that contains both a `CompiledRecipe` and the required `InteractionInstances`, or they can as well be converted
into a [visualziation](visualization.md).

```scala tab="Scala"
import com.ing.baker.compiler.RecipeCompiler
import com.ing.baker.il.CompiledRecipe

val compiledRecipe: CompiledRecipe = RecipeCompiler.compileRecipe(recipe)
```

```java tab="Java"
import com.ing.baker.compiler.RecipeCompiler;
import com.ing.baker.il.CompiledRecipe;

CompiledRecipe compiledRecipe = RecipeCompiler.compileRecipe(recipe);
```

## baker.addRecipe(compiledRecipe)

Once `Recipes` have been transformed into `CompiledRecipes` they must be added to a baker runtime. The `baker.addRecipe(compiledRecipe)`
API will do so and return an id that you can use to reference the added recipe later on.

_Note: Before doing this, baker requires you to add all related `InteractionInstances` to the runtime, this is because baker 
does validation to ensure that every recipe is runnable from the previously added `InteractionInstances`._

```scala tab="Scala"
val recipeId Future[String] = baker.addRecipe(compiledRecipe)
```

```java tab="Java"
CompletableFuture<String> recipeId = baker.addRecipe(compiledRecipe);
```

## baker.getAllRecipes()

The baker at runtime can give you a map of all the currently available recipes that has been previously added to Baker.

```scala tab="Scala"
import com.ing.baker.runtime.scaladsl.RecipeInformation
import scala.concurrent.Future

val allRecipes: Future[Map[String, RecipeInformation]] = baker.getAllRecipes
```

```java tab="Java"
import com.ing.baker.runtime.javadsl.RecipeInformation;
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import java.util.Map;

CompletableFuture<Map<String, RecipeInformation>> allRecipe = baker.getAllRecipes();
```

## baker.bake(recipeId, recipeInstanceId)

Once the Baker runtime contains a `CompiledRecipe` and all the associated `InteractionInstances` then you can use the 
`baker.bake(recipeId, recipeInstanceId)` API to create a `RecipeInstance` that will contain the state of your process
and execute any `InteractionInstance` as soon as all its required `InteractionIngredients` are available.
 
_Note: This API requires you to choose a `recipeInstanceId`, the API does not provide one for you, this is so that 
you can manage this reference as required._

_Note: in Java the api returns a `CompletableFuture<BoxedUnit>`, this is because the API is implemented in Scala, so 
Scala's `Unit` get translated to `BoxedUnit`, but you should you ignore it and consider it as good as Java's `void`,
except it comes in a `CompletableFuture` that will help you handle async programming._

```scala tab="Scala"
val program: Future[Unit] = for {
  _ <- baker.addInteractionInstance(interactionInstances)
  recipeId <- baker.addRecipe(compiledRecipe)
  recipeInstanceId = "my-id"
  _ <- baker.bake(recipeId, recipeInstanceId)
} yield ()
```

```java tab="Java"
String recipeInstanceId = "my-id";
CompletableFuture<BoxedUnit> result = baker.addInteractionInstace(reserveItemsInstance)
    .thenCompose(ignore -> baker.addRecipe(compiledRecipe))
    .thenCompose(recipeId -> baker.bake(recipeId, recipeInstanceId));
```

## EventInstance.from(object)

As part of our efforts to ease the creation of `EventInstances`, we added a function that uses Java and Scala reflection 
to create `EventInstances` from class objects.

The name of the `EventInstance` will be taken from the name of the `class` (Java) or `case class` (Scala) 
(it must match the name of the `Event` at the `Recipe`). And the argument names and types of the constructors will be 
translated to `IngredientInstances` with corresponding names and baker types.

Notice that this function might throw an exception if the event is not correctly done (this is why in Scala the API is
named "unsafe").

```scala tab="Scala"
import com.ing.baker.runtime.scaladsl.EventInstance

case class OrderPlaced(orderId: String, items: List[String])

val firstOrderPlaced: EventInstance = 
    EventInstance.unsafeFrom(OrderPlaced("order-id", List("item1", "item2")))
```

```java tab="Java"
import com.ing.baker.runtime.javadsl.EventInstance;

class OrderPlaced {

    String orderId;
    List<String> items;
    
    public OrderPlaced(String orderId, List<String> items) {
        this.orderId = orderId;
        this.items = items;
    }
}

EventInstance firstOrderPlaced =
    EventInstance.from(new JWebshopRecipe.OrderPlaced("order-uuid", items));
```

## baker.fireEvent(recipeInstanceId, eventInstance)

After creation of a `RecipeInstance`, you use one of the variations of `baker.fireEvent(recipeInstanceId, eventInstance)`
to fire your `EventInstances` and start/continue the process flow. There are several supported semantics for firing an 
event which depend on the moment you want to get notified and continue your asynchronous computation, these are the 4 
different moments:

1. When the event got accepted by the `RecipeInstance` but has not started cascading the execution of `InteractionInstances`. 
For this use the `Baker.fireEventAndResolveWhenReceived(recipeInstanceId, eventInstance)` API. This will return a 
`Future[SensoryEventStatus]` enum notifying of the outcome (the event might get rejected).

2. When the event got accepted by the `RecipeInstance` and has finished cascading the execution of `InteractionInstances`
up to the point that it requires more `EventInstances` (`SensoryEvents`) to continue, or the process has finished.
For this use the `Baker.fireEventAndResolveWhenCompleted(recipeInstanceId, eventInstance)` API. This will return a 
`Future[EventResult]` object containing a `SensoryEventStatus`, the `Event` names that got fired in consequence of this 
`SensoryEvent`, and the current available `Ingredients` output of the `InteractionInstances` that got executed as consequence 
of the `SensoryEvent`.

3. You want to do something on both of the previously mentioned moments, then use the 
`Baker.fireEvent(recipeInstanceId, eventInstance)` API, which will return an `EventResolutions` object which contains both
`Future[SensoryEventStatus]` and `Future[EventResult]` (or its `CompletableFuture<A>` equivalents in Java).

4. As soon as an intermediate `Event` fires from one of the `InteractionInstances` that execute as consequence of the fired
`SensoryEvent`. For this use the `Baker.fireEventAndResolveOnEvent(recipeInstanceId, eventInstance, onEventName)` API. This will return 
a similar `Future[EventResult` to the one returned by `Baker.fireEventAndResolveWhenCompleted` except the data will be up
to the moment the `onEventName` was fired.

### correlationId

Optionally you may provide a `correlation id` when firing a `EventInstance`. The purpose of this identifier is idempotent 
event delivery: when sending the same event correlation id multiple times, only the first will be processed.

This can be applied to the `OrderPlaced` event for example.

``` scala tab="Scala"
val correlationOrderId = "a unique order id"

for {
    statusA <- baker.processEventAndResolveWhenReceived(recipeInstanceId, orderPlacedEvent, correlationOrderId)
    _ = assert(statusA == Received)
    statusB <- baker.processEventAndResolveWhenReceived(recipeInstanceId, orderPlacedEvent, correlationOrderId)
    _ = assert(statusB == AlreadyReceived)
} yield ()
```

``` java tab="Java"
String correlationOrderId = "a unique order id";

SensoryEventStatus statusA = baker
    .processEventAndResolveWhenReceived(recipeInstanceId, orderPlacedEvent, correlationOrderId);
    .join();
assert(statusA == Received);

SensoryEventStatus statusB = baker
    .processEventAndResolveWhenReceived(recipeInstanceId, orderPlacedEvent, correlationOrderId);
    .join();
assert(statusB == AlreadyReceived);

```

### SensoryEventStatus

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Received` | The event was received normally |
| `AlreadyReceived` | An event with the same correlation id was already received |
| `ProcessDeleted` | The process instance was deleted |
| `ReceivePeriodExpired` | The receive period for the process instance has passed |
| `FiringLimitMet` | The `firing limit` for the event was met |


## baker.getRecipeInstanceState(recipeInstanceId)

`baker.getInteractionInstanceState(recipeInstanceId)` will return an `InteractionInstanceState` object which 
contains all the event names with timestamps that have executed, and the current available provided ingredient data.

```scala tab="Scala"
import com.ing.baker.runtime.scaladsl.RecipeInstanceState
  
val state: Future[RecipeInstanceState] = baker.getRecipeInstanceState(recipeInstanceId)
```

```java tab="Java"
import com.ing.baker.runtime.javadsl.RecipeInstanceState;
  
CompletableFuture<RecipeInstanceState> state = baker.getRecipeInstanceState(recipeInstanceId);
```

## baker.getAllInteractionInstancesMetadata()
    
Returns the recipeId, recipeInstanceId and creation timestamp of all running `RecipeInstances`.

_Note: Can potentially return a partial result when baker runs in cluster mode because not all shards might be reached within 
the given timeout._

_Note: Does not include deleted `RecipeInstances`._

## baker.getVisualState(recipeInstanceId, style)

Another method of fetching state is the visual representation of it. You can do that with the `Baker.getVisualState(recipeInstanceId)`
API. This will return a GraphViz string like the [visualization api]() that you can convert into an image.

Here is a visualization of the state of another webshop example, one can clearly see that the process is flowing correctly
without failures and that it is still waiting for the payment sensory event to be fired.

```scala tab="Scala"
val state: Future[String] = baker.getVisualState(recipeInstanceId)
```

```java tab="Java"
CompletableFuture<String> state = baker.getVisualState(recipeInstanceId);
```

## baker.registerEventListener(recipeName, listenerFunction)

Registers a listener to all runtime events for this baker instance.

Note that:
- The delivery guarantee is *AT MOST ONCE*. Practically this means you can miss events when the application terminates (unexpected or not).
- The delivery is local (JVM) only, you will NOT receive events from other nodes when running in cluster mode.

Because of these constraints you should not use an event listener for critical functionality. Valid use cases might be:
- logging
- metrics
- unit tests

```scala tab="Scala"
baker.registerEventListener((recipeInstanceId: String, event: EventInstance) => {
  println(s"Recipe instance : $recipeInstanceId processed event ${event.name}")
})
```

```java tab="Java"
BiConsumer<String, EventInstance> handler = (String recipeInstanceId, EventInstance event) ->
    System.out.println("Recipe Instance " + recipeInstanceId + " processed event " + event.name());
    
baker.registerEventListener(handler);
```

## baker.registerBakerEventListener(listenerFunction)

Registers a listener to all runtime BAKER events, these are events that notify what Baker is doing, like `RecipeInstances`
received `EventInstances` or `CompiledRecipes` being added to baker.

Note that:
- The delivery guarantee is *AT MOST ONCE*. Practically this means you can miss events when the application terminates (unexpected or not).
- The delivery is local (JVM) only, you will NOT receive events from other nodes when running in cluster mode.

Because of these constraints you should not use an event listener for critical functionality. Valid use cases might be:
- logging
- metrics
- unit tests

```scala tab="Scala"
import com.ing.baker.runtime.scaladsl._

baker.registerBakerEventListener((event: BakerEvent) => {
  event match {
    case e: EventReceived => println(e)
    case e: EventRejected => println(e)
    case e: InteractionFailed => println(e)
    case e: InteractionStarted => println(e)
    case e: InteractionCompleted => println(e)
    case e: ProcessCreated => println(e)
    case e: RecipeAdded => println(e)
  }
})
```

```java tab="Java"
import com.ing.baker.runtime.javadsl.BakerEvent;

baker.registerBakerEventListener((BakerEvent event) -> System.out.println(event));
```

## baker.retryInteraction(recipeInstanceId, interactionName)

It is possible that during the execution of a `RecipeInstance` it becomes *blocked*, this can happen either because it 
is `directly blocked` by an exception (and the `FailureStrategy` of the `Interaction` of the `Recipe` was set to block) 
or that the retry strategy was exhausted. At this point it is possible to resolve the blocked interaction in 2 ways. 
This one involves forcing another try, resulting either on a successful continued process, or again on a failed state, 
to check this you will need to request the state of the `RecipeInstance` again.

_Note: this behaviour can be automatically preconfigured by using the `RetryWithIncrementalBackoff` `FailureStrategy`
on the `Interaction` of the `Recipe`_

``` scala tab="Scala"
val program: Future[Unit] = 
    baker.retryInteraction(recipeInstanceId, "ReserveItems")
```

``` java tab="Java"
CompletableFuture<BoxedUnit> program = 
    baker.retryInteraction(recipeInstanceId, "ReserveItems");
```

## baker.resolveInteraction(recipeInstanceId, interactionName, event)

It is possible that during the execution of a `RecipeInstance` it becomes *blocked*, this can happen either because it 
is `directly blocked` by an exception or that the retry strategy was exhausted. At this point it is possible to resolve 
the blocked interaction in two ways. This one involves resolving the interaction with a chosen `EventInstance` to replace
the one that would have had been computed by the `InteractionInstance`.

_Note: this behaviour can be automatically preconfigured by using the `FireEventAfterFailure(eventName)` `FailureStrategy`
on the `Interaction` of the `Recipe`_

``` scala tab="Scala"
val program: Future[Unit] = 
    baker.resolveInteraction(recipeInstanceId, "ReserveItems", ItemsReserved(List("item1")))
```

``` java tab="Java"
CompletableFuture<BoxedUnit> program = 
    baker.resolveInteraction(recipeInstanceId, "ReserveItems", new ItemsReserved(List("item1")));
```

## baker.stopRetryingInteraction(recipeInstanceId, interactionName)

If an `Interaction` is configured with a `RetryWithIncrementalBackoff` `FailureStrategy` then it will not stop retrying 
until you call this API or a successful outcome happens from the `InteractionInstance`.

``` scala tab="Scala"
val program: Future[Unit] = 
    baker.stopRetryingInteraction(recipeInstanceId, "ReserveItems")
```

``` java tab="Java"
CompletableFuture<BoxedUnit> program = 
    baker.stopRetryingInteraction(recipeInstanceId, "ReserveItems");
```
