Developers declare the orchestration logic in a Recipe (process blueprint). A Recipe is made out of: Interactions (functions) Ingredients (containers for data) Events The Baker runtime on the other hand runs instances of the Recipe across a cluster of nodes in an asynchronous fashion. Baker allows you to Declaratively design your business processes using a recipe Domain Specific Language (DSL) . Visualize your recipe allowing product owners, architects and developers to talk the same language. Manage your recipes using the Baker runtime . Create process instances of your recipes. Fire sensory events . Inquire the state of your recipe instances. Why Baker Upgrading your business to an agile, adaptive and scalable microservice-based architecture does bring significant advantages, but also critical challenges that must be resolved: the coupling of business logic to service technologies and the inherent complexities of distributed systems Baker solves these challenges by providing an expressive language to encode your business logic (recipe) , and a distributed runtime to scale recipe instances with little configuration and no extra development. Decouple your business logic from your microservices : When developing microservices it is easy to fall into bad practices where developers encode essential business logic into code which might get polluted with implementation details, and even worse, distributed over many independent projects/repositories. Baker, in contrast, requires the developer to express the business logic as a Recipe by using the provided language DSL, and separately code implementations of the data (events) and the process steps (interactions) , enforcing decoupling of business from technology. Ease the friction of distributed systems : When developing microservices you are confronted with all the inherent challenges of distributed systems, topics like communication models, consistency decisions, handling failure, scaling models, etc. Baker eases the development by providing out-of-the-box solutions from its clusterized runtime. Baker nodes are able to create and distribute recipe instances between them, handle failed interactions with several strategies, restore the state of long-lived process and more, allowing the developer to focus on what it matters for the business. Reason about your business process without the burdens of technology : Baker can visualize your recipes , enabling developers and business stakeholders to better communicate and reason about the business processes. Example of a simple web shop recipe: How to read these docs There are two big sections: The Development Life Cycle : works like a big tutorial of Baker, it is a \"learning by making\" type of documentation, it is for those who like a top-down approach to learning. The Reference : has descriptions of every part of Baker, it is a \"dictionary/reference\" type of documentation, it is for those who like a bottom-up approach to learning, and also works as a reference for quickly reviewing concepts in the future.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Baker is a library that reduces the effort to orchestrate (micro)service-based process flows.

This does not yet constitute a runnable process. It is just a description. To execute manage your recipes you require the Baker Runtime . Starting the baker runtime Creating a baker runtime is as easy as calling the empty constructor. Scala // Create a Baker Runtime val baker = new Baker (); Java // Create a Baker Runtime JBaker baker = new JBaker (); Baker is build on top of akka . It requires an ActorSystem to start. In the previous example the actor system is not provided. In that case baker will create an actor system for you. If you already have an actor system then you can give it to Baker. Scala val actorSystem = ActorSystem (); Baker baker = new Baker ( actorSystem ); Java ActorSystem actorSystem = ActorSystem . create (); JBaker baker = new JBaker ( actorSystem ); Adding interaction implementations Before you can add a recipe all the interactions for that recipe MUST have an implemention in Baker. You can add them like this: Scala val validateOrderImpl = new ValidateOrderImpl () baker . addImplementation ( validateOrderImpl ) Java ValidateOrderImpl validateOrderImpl = new ValidateOrderImpl (); baker . addImplementation ( validateOrderImpl ); Compiling your Recipe A recipe is writen in a DSL .

With these three components we can create recipes (process blue prints) Ingredient Ingredients are pure data . This data is immutable , can not be changed after entering the process. There is no hi\u00ebrarchy in this data. ( Animal - Dog - Labrador is not possible to express) Examples: an IBAN a track and trace code a list of phone numbers a customer information object with name, email, etc ... An ingredient is defined by a name and type . The name points to the intended meaning of the data. (\"customerData\", \"orderNumber\", ...) The type sets limits on the form of data that is accepted. (a number, a list of strings, ...) This type is expressed by the baker type system . Interaction An interaction is analagous to a function. It requires input ( ingredients ) and provides output ( events ). Within this contract it may do anything. For example: query an external system put a message on a bus generate a document or image extract or compose ingredients into others When finished, an interaction provides an event as its output. Interaction failure An interaction may fail to fulfill its intended purpose. We distinquish 2 types of failures. A technical failure is one that could be retried and succeed. For example: Time outs because of unreliable network, packet loss External system is temporarily down or unresponsive External system returned a malformed/unexpected response These failures are unexpected and are are modeled by throwing an exception from the interaction. A functional failure is one that cannot be retried. For example: The customer is too young for the request. Not enough credit to perform the transfer. These failures are expected possible outcomes of the interaction. They are modelled by returning an event from the interaction. Failure mitigation In case of technical failures, baker offers 2 mitigation strategies: Retry with incremental backoff This retries the interaction with some configurable parameters: initialTimeout : The initial delay for the first retry. backoffFactor : The backoff factor. maximumInterval : The maximum interval between retries. Continue with an event. This is analagous to a try/catch in java code. The exception is logged but the process continues with a specified event. When no failure strategy is defined for an interaction by default the interaction is blocked . Event An event has a name and can (optionally) provide ingredients. The purpose of events is therefor twofold. It signifies something of interest happened for a process instance . Example, \"the customer placed the order\" , \"terms and conditions were accepted\" The event may provide ingredients required to continue the process. Example, \"OrderPlaced\" - list of products We distinquish 2 types of events. Sensory events ( external ) These events are provided from outside of the process. Interaction output ( internal ) These events are a result of an interaction being executed. Recipe Events , Interactions and Ingredients can be composed into recipes. Recipes are analagous to process blueprints. Baker provides a Recipe DSL in which you can declaritively describe your recipe. A small example: new Recipe ( webshop ) . withSensoryEvents ( OrderPlaced . class , CustomerInfoReceived . class . withInteractions ( of ( ValidateOrder . class ), of ( ManufactureGoods . class )); The main take away is that when declaring your recipe you do not have to think about order.

Event delivery is AT MOST ONCE In case of ungraceful shutdown, you may miss events. Because of these limitations it is not recommended to use these listeners for primary business logic.

Either given to baker as a \"SensoryEvent\" (nickname for EventInstances that you fire using Baker APIs) or by an InteractionInstance . A check is done to find the Interactions that have all their input IngredientInstances provided and those are executed. An InteractionInstance completes its execution and outputs an EventInstances which provides more IngredientInstances for the next InteractionInstnaces (repeating step 1). Notes A sensory event may be provided 1 or more times depending on its firing limit . When ingredients are provided multiple times, the latest value overrides the previous. An interaction fires when all it's ingredients and required events are provided. This may happen 1 or more times depending on the maximum interaction count . To know more you will first need to understand the how a petri net works. Below is an explanation of how a recipe relates to a petri net. In depth A recipe can be represented (and visualized ) as a graph. This graph is actually a higher level representation of a petri net (which is also a graph). The execution of a process instance is based around the state of a petri net. The recipe compiler takes a recipe and creates a petri net from it. Generally the petri net graph is more complicated with extra layers of wiring nodes. Translation rules The compiler has some rules about translating recipe parts to transitions and places in the petri net. Ingredient used by multiple interactions Often an ingredient will be used by multiple interactions in a recipe. Because tokens can only be consumed by 1 transition we have to add a layer to duplicate the token for all transitions. Interaction with precondition (AND) By default event preconditions use an AND combinator. In the petri net this means that each event transition has to produce a token in a place for that interaction. Interaction with precodition (OR) Events that are grouped in an OR combinator for an interaction output a token to the same place, therefor when one of them fires the condition for the transition to fire is met. Sensory event with firing limit When specifying a sensory event with a firing limit of n we generate a in-adjacent place with n tokens in the initial marking.","title":"Execution Semantics"},{"location":"archive/execution-semantics/#execution-semantics","text":"","title":"Execution Semantics"},{"location":"archive/execution-semantics/#execution-loop","text":"This is a short description of the execution loop of a process instance A EventInstance is raised and provides IngredientInstances .

Lets summarize what we have done so far. Scala // To execute a recipe you will need a Baker instance // This should be the same instance as you used to register your Recipe val baker : Baker = ??? // The recipe id was given to us when we add our Recipe to Baker val recipeId : String = ??? Java // To execute a recipe you will need a Baker instance // This should be the same instance as you used to register your Recipe JBaker baker = null ; // // The recipe id was given to us when we add our Recipe to Baker String recipeId = ... ; Create a process instance Given a valid recipe id we can now execute a Recipe. Or in other words we can create a process instance . Scala // Assuming you have a compiled recipe val recipe : CompiledRecipe = ??? // A unique identifier ment to distinguish this process from other process instances val recipeInstanceId = a-unique-process-id // Tell Baker that we want to create a new process for a certain recipe. baker . bake ( recipe . recipeId , recipeInstanceId ) Java // Assuming you have a compiled recipe CompiledRecipe recipe = null ; // // A unique identifier ment to distinguish this process from other process instances String recipeInstanceId = a-unique-process-id ; // Tell Baker that we want to create a new process for a certain recipe. baker . bake ( recipe . recipeId (), recipeInstanceId ); Providing a sensory event In our webshop example the first events that can happen are OrderPlaced , PaymentMade and CustomerInfoReceived . These are so called sensory events since they are not the result of an interaction but must be provided by the user of Baker. Scala // The CustomerInfoReceived and OrderPlaced events require some data (Ingredients) val customerInfo = CustomerInfo ( John , Elm. Street , johndoe@example.com ) val order = 123 ; // Lets produce the `OrderPlaced` and `CustomerInfoReceived` sensory Events. baker . processEvent ( recipeInstanceId , CustomerInfoRecived ( customerInfo )) baker . processEvent ( recipeInstanceId , OrderPlaced ( order )) Java // The CustomerInfoReceived and OrderPlaced events require some data (Ingredients) CustomerInfo customerInfo = new CustomerInfo ( John , Elm. Street , johndoe@example.com ); String order = 123 ; // Lets produce the `OrderPlaced` and `CustomerInfoReceived` sensory Events. baker . processEvent ( recipeInstanceId , new CustomerInfoReceived ( customerInfo )); baker . processEvent ( recipeInstanceId , new OrderPlaced ( order )); When receiving events Baker will check which Interactions have all the required Ingredients and Events met. It will execute those interactions. Those interactions will raise more events. For more information about the exact execution sementics see here . Correlation id Optionally you may provide a correlation id with an event. The purpose of this identifier is idempotent event delivery. When sending the same event correlation id multiple times, only the first will be processed. This can be applied to the OrderPlaced event for example. Scala val orderId = a unique order id val statusA : SensoryEventStatus = baker . processEvent ( recipeInstanceId , new OrderPlaced ( order ), orderId ) val statusB : SensoryEventStatus = baker . processEvent ( recipeInstanceId , new OrderPlaced ( order ), orderId ) // statusA == Received // statusB == AlreadyReceived Java String orderId = a unique order id ; SensoryEventStatus statusA = baker . processEvent ( recipeInstanceId , new OrderPlaced ( order ), orderId ); SensoryEventStatus statusB = baker . processEvent ( recipeInstanceId , new OrderPlaced ( order ), orderId ); // statusA == Received // statusB == AlreadyReceived Sensory event status In response to receiving a sensory event Baker returns a status code indicating how it processed it. Status Description Received The event was received normally AlreadyReceived An event with the same correlation id was already received ProcessDeleted The process instance was deleted ReceivePeriodExpired The receive period for the process instance has passed FiringLimitMet The firing limit for the event was met Incident resolving It is possible that during execution a process instance becomes blocked . This can happen either because it is directly blocked by a exception or that the retry strategy was exhuasted. At this point it is possible to resolve the blocked interaction in 2 ways. 1. Force retry For example, the retry strategy for \"SendInvoice\" was exhausted after a few hours or retrying. However, we checked and know the \"invoice\" service is up again and want to continue to process for our customer. Scala baker . retryInteraction ( recipeInstanceId , SendInvoice ) Java baker . retryInteraction ( recipeInstanceId , SendInvoice ); 2. Specify the interaction output For example, the \"ShipGoods\" backend service is not idempotent and failed with an exception. It is not retried but blocked . However, we checked and know the goods were actually shipped and want to continue the process for our customer. Scala baker . resolveInteraction ( recipeInstanceId , ShipGoods , GoodsShipped ( some goods )) Java baker . resolveInteraction ( recipeInstanceId , ShipGoods , new GoodsShipped ( some goods )); Note that the event provided SHOULD NOT include any event or ingredient renames specified for the interaction. State inquiry During runtime it is often useful to inquire on the state of a process instance. Visualize process instance state We can use the visualizer to see what Baker has done with the given events. Scala val dotRepresentation : String = baker . getVisualState ( recipeInstanceId ) Java String dotRepresentation = baker . getVisualState ( recipeInstanceId ); Did you know?! You can ask baker for a visual representation of a certain process. That way you can see which Events were provided and which Interaction were run. See the visualization page how to create a visual graph. The image shows us that the ValidateOrder Interaction is colored green which means that the Interaction has been exucuted. Baker was able to exeucte the Interaction because all required Events and Ingredients where provided. The ValidateOrder Interaction in turn produced the Valid event. We can also see that the ManufactureGoods Interaction is still purple, meaning that it has not been executed. This is correct because ManufactureGoods requires an additional event called PaymentMade . Events We can ask Baker for a list of all the events for our process. Using this list we can check if the InvoiceWasSend event was produced. Scala // Get all events that have happend for this process instance val events : Seq [ RuntimeEvent ] = baker . getEvents ( recipeInstanceId ) if ( events . exists ( _ . name == InvoiceWasSend )) // Yes the invoice was send! Java // Get all events that have happend for this process instance EventList events = baker . getEvents ( recipeInstanceId ); if ( events . hasEventOccurred ( InvoiceWasSend . class )) // Yes the invoice was send! Ingredients Sometimes it is useful to know what the ingredient values are accumulated for a process instance. For example, you might want to know the value of the trackingId . Scala // Get all ingredients that are accumulated for a process instance val ingredients : Map [ String , Value ] = baker . getIngredients ( recipeInstanceId ) val trackingId : String = ingredients ( trackingId ). as [ String ] Java // Get all ingredients that are accumulated for a process instance Map String , Value ingredients = baker . getIngredients ( recipeInstanceId ); String trackingId = ingredients . get ( trackingId ). as ( String . class );","title":"Process Execution"},{"location":"archive/process-execution/#process-execution","text":"","title":"Process Execution"},{"location":"archive/process-execution/#recap","text":"On the runtime page we discussed how you could initialize Baker and add your recipe to it.

Let's start with the web shop recipe as an example. The complete code example can be found here . final Recipe webshopRecipe = new Recipe ( webshop ) . withSensoryEvents ( OrderPlaced . class , CustomerInfoReceived . class , PaymentMade . class ) . withInteractions ( of ( ValidateOrder . class ), of ( ManufactureGoods . class ) . withRequiredEvents ( PaymentMade . class , ValidateOrder . Valid . class ), of ( SendInvoice . class ) . withRequiredEvents ( ShipGoods . GoodsShipped . class ), of ( ShipGoods . class )) . withDefaultFailureStrategy ( new RetryWithIncrementalBackoffBuilder () . withInitialDelay ( Duration . ofMillis ( 100 )) . withDeadline ( Duration . ofHours ( 24 )) . withMaxTimeBetweenRetries ( Duration . ofMinutes ( 10 )) . build ()); Sensory events Events are simple POJO classes. For example: Scala case class CustomerInfoReceived ( customerInfo : CustomerInfo ) Java public class CustomerInfoReceived { public final CustomerInfo customerInfo ; public CustomerInfoReceived ( CustomerInfo customerInfo ) { this . customerInfo = customerInfo ; } } The field types of the POJO class must be compatible with the Baker type system. See the supported types for more information. The names of the fields are obtained using java reflection. They can be added using the .withSensoryEvents(..) method. Firing limit A firing limit is a limit on the number of times a sensory event may be received by a process instance . By default sensory events have a firing limit of 1 per process instance. This means the event will be rejected with status FiringLimitMet after the first time it is received. If you want to send an event more then once you may add it like this: . withSensoryEventsNoFiringLimit ( CustomerInfoReceived . class ) In this example the CustomerInfoReceived can now be received multiple times by a process instance. Interactions Interactions are interfaces with some requirements. See here how to define them. You can include interactions in your recipe using the static of(..) method. import static com.ing.baker.recipe.javadsl.InteractionDescriptor.of ; final Recipe webshopRecipe = new Recipe ( webshop ) . withInteractions ( of ( ValidateOrder . class ) ) There are a number of options to tailor an interaction for your recipe. Maximum interaction count By default there is no limit on the number of times an Interaction may fire. Sometimes you may want to set a limit. For example, to ensure the goods are shipped only once. . withInteractions ( of ( ShipGoods . class ). withMaximumInteractionCount ( 1 ) ) Predefining ingredients An interaction normally requires all its input ingredients to be provided from Events . Sometimes however it is useful to predefine (or hard code ) the value of an ingredient. For example: An email template An application/requester id when calling an external system This can be done by: . withInteractions ( of ( SendEmail . class ) . withPredefinedIngredient ( emailTemplate , Welcome to ING! ) ) Note that predefined ingredients are always available and do not have to be provided by an event for each interaction call. Each time all remaining ingredients are provided, the interaction will fire. You can not predefine ALL input ingredients of an interaction. Event renames Sometimes it useful to rename an interaction event and/or its ingredients to fit better in the context of your recipe. For example, to rename the GoodsManufactured event and its ingredient. . withInteractions ( of ( ManufactureGoods . class ) . withEventTransformation ( GoodsManufactured . class , ManufacturingDone , ImmutableMap . of ( goods , manufacturedGoods ) ) ) ) Event requirements As mentioned before, the DSL is declarative, you do not have to think about order. This is implicit in the data requirements of the interactions. However, sometimes data requirements are not enough. For example, you might want to be sure to only send an invoice ( SendInvoice ) AFTER the goods where shipped ( GoodsShipped ). of ( SendInvoice . class ) . withRequiredEvents ( ShipGoods . GoodsShipped . class ) In this case the GoodsShipped event MUST happen before the interaction may execute. You can specify multiple events in a single clause. These are bundled with an AND condition, meaning ALL events in the clause are required. You can also require a single event from a number of options. of ( SendInvoice . class ) . withRequiredOneOfEvents ( EventA . class , EventB . class ) In this case the interaction may fire if either EventA OR EventB has occured. Interaction Failure strategy When an interaction throws an exception there are a number of mitigation strategies: Block interaction This is the DEFAULT strategy if no other is defined and no default strategy is defined. This option is suitable for non idempotent interactions that cannot be retried. When an exception is thrown from the interaction the interaction is blocked . This means that the interaction cannot execute again automatically. It requires manual intervening to continue the process from then on. Fire event This option is analagous to a try { } catch { } in code. When an exception is raised from the interaction you specify an event to fire. So instead of failing the process continues. Example: . withInteractions ( of ( ValidateOrder . class ) . withInteractionFailureStrategy ( InteractionFailureStrategy . FireEvent ( ValidateOrderFailed ) ) ) Retry with incremental backoff Incremental backoff allows you to configure a retry mechanism that takes longer for each retry. The idea here is that you quickly retry at first but slower over time. To not overload your system but give it time to recover. . withInteractions ( of ( ValidateOrder . class ) . withFailureStrategy ( new RetryWithIncrementalBackoffBuilder () . withInitialDelay ( Duration . ofMillis ( 100 )) . withBackoffFactor ( 2.0 ) . withMaxTimeBetweenRetries ( Duration . ofSeconds ( 100 )) . withDeadline ( Duration . ofHours ( 24 )) . build ()) ) What do these parameters mean? name meaning initialDelay The delay for the first retry. backoffFactor The backoff factor for the delay (optional, default = 2 ) maxTimeBetweenRetries The maximum interval between retries. deadLine The maximum total amount of time spend delaying. For our example this results in the following delay pattern: 100 millis - 200 millis - 400 millis - ... - 100 seconds - 100 seconds Which can be visualized like this: Note that these delays do not include interaction execution time. For example, if the first retry execution takes 5 seconds (and fails again) then the second retry will be triggered after (from the start): (100 millis + 5 seconds + 200 millis) = 5.3 seconds This also means that the 24 hour deadline does not include interaction execution time. It is advisable to take this into account when coming up with this number. Retry exhaustion It can happen that after some time, when an interaction keeps failing, that the retry is exhausted. When this happens 2 things may happen. Either the interaction becomes [blocked(#blocked-interaction). Or if you configure so, the process continues with a predefined event: .withFailureStrategy ( new RetryWithIncrementalBackoffBuilder () .withFireRetryExhaustedEvent ( SomeEvent.class )) Note that this event class requires an empty constructor to be present and cannot provide ingredients. Default failure strategy You can also define a default failure strategy on the recipe level. This then serves as a fallback if none is defined for an interaction. For example: final Recipe webshopRecipe = new Recipe ( webshop ) . withDefaultFailureStrategy ( new RetryWithIncrementalBackoffBuilder () . withInitialDelay ( Duration . ofMillis ( 100 )) . withDeadline ( Duration . ofHours ( 24 )) . withMaxTimeBetweenRetries ( Duration . ofMinutes ( 10 )) . build ());","title":"Recipe DSL"},{"location":"archive/recipe-dsl/#recipe-dsl","text":"The recipe DSL allows you to declaritively describe your process.

For our example this results in the following delay pattern: 100 millis - 200 millis - 400 millis - ... - 100 seconds - 100 seconds Which can be visualized like this: Note that these delays do not include interaction execution time. For example, if the first retry execution takes 5 seconds (and fails again) then the second retry will be triggered after (from the start): (100 millis + 5 seconds + 200 millis) = 5.3 seconds This also means that the 24 hour deadline does not include interaction execution time. It is advisable to take this into account when coming up with this number. Retry exhaustion It can happen that after some time, when an interaction keeps failing, that the retry is exhausted. When this happens 2 things may happen. Either the interaction becomes [blocked(#blocked-interaction). Or if you configure so, the process continues with a predefined event: .withFailureStrategy ( new RetryWithIncrementalBackoffBuilder () .withFireRetryExhaustedEvent ( SomeEvent.class )) Note that this event class requires an empty constructor to be present and cannot provide ingredients.","title":"Retry with incremental backoff"},{"location":"archive/recipe-dsl/#default-failure-strategy","text":"You can also define a default failure strategy on the recipe level.

If your Baker application is using local actors, thus not using Akka cluster, a Split Brain Resolver is not needed. Baker library, when configured to be a cluster, runs in an Akka cluster to distribute the baker processes over multiple nodes. Running a cluster with multiple nodes with shared state has some difficulties to tackle in some network failure scenarios, like network partitions. When there's a network partition in a cluster, the nodes at the different sides of the partition cannot receive messages from each other and eventually diverge their states unless it is a network hick-up. When this happens, you need a mechanism to prevent state inconsistency, i.e. by stopping nodes at one side of the partition, so the nodes at the surviving side still run with consistent states. A Split Brain Resolver algorithm for Akka prevents inconsistent states during network partitions, or huge network delays, or non-responding cluster members. Baker Split Brain Resolver is a general purpose implementation for Akka which could be configured for a Baker cluster as well as for another Akka cluster without bBker. Strategies The current version of the Split Brain Resolver algorithm supports only the Majority strategy which makes the majority of the nodes survive and downs (terminates) the nodes at the minority side of the network partition. In case of the number of nodes on each side of the network partition are equal, the side with the oldest Akka node survives. By deciding to down one side, you do not end up with twi Akka clusters during the network partition. There could be other strategies implemented later, for now the Majority strategy works for most of the use cases. You can read about other possible strategies supported by the commercial Lightbend Split Brain Resolver here . Majority strategy is configured by default, so you do not need extra configuration for this. How to use In order to use Baker SplitBrainResolver , first of all, you need to add baker-split-brain-resolver dependency to your project. See example below: Sbt libraryDependencies += com.ing.baker %% baker-split-brain-resolver % 2.0.3 Maven dependency groupId com.ing.baker /groupId artifactId baker-split-brain-resolver_2.12 /artifactId version 2.0.3 /version /dependency Then the algorithm needs to be configured as the Akka downing provider and the stable-after config needs to set to some duration depending on your cluster size. stable-after config is needed to decide on how quickly to react on the Akka cluster state changes. Very short durations may allow quicker 'downing' decisions for unreachable nodes, but may also cause to down some nodes unnecessarily too early. Please see the suggested values for this in the documentation of the commercial Lightbend Split Brain Resolver. One other Akka cluster configuration suggested keep in sync with stable-after is the akka.cluster.down-removal-margin config. The suggested values and more information on this config can be found in the Cluster Singleton and Cluster Sharding section of the commercial Lightbend Split Brain Resolver. Example config for a Baker cluster having less than 10 nodes is the following: akka . cluster . down - removal - margin = 7 seconds akka . cluster . downing - provider - class = com . ing . baker . runtime . core . actor . downing .

With these three components we can create recipes (process blue prints) Ingredient Ingredients are pure data . This data is immutable and can not be changed after entering the process. There is no hierarchy in this data. ( Animal - Dog - Labrador is not possible to express) Examples: an IBAN a track and trace code a list of phone numbers a customer information object with name, email, etc ... An ingredient is defined by a name and type . The name points to the intended meaning of the data. (\"customerData\", \"orderNumber\", ...) The type sets limits on the form of data that is accepted. (a number, a list of strings, ...) This type is expressed by the Baker type system . Interaction An interaction is similar to a function. It requires input ( ingredients ) and provides output ( events ). Within this contract it may do anything. For example: query an external system put a message on a bus generate a document or image extract or compose ingredients into others When finished, an interaction provides an event as its output. Interaction failure An interaction may fail to fulfill its intended purpose. We distinquish two types of failures. A technical failure is one that could be retried and succeed. For example: Time outs because of an unreliable network or packet loss External system is temporarily down or unresponsive External system returned a malformed/unexpected response These failures are unexpected and are modeled by throwing an exception from the interaction. A functional failure is one that cannot be retried. For example: The customer is too young for the request. Not enough credit to perform the transfer. These failures are expected possible outcomes of the interaction. They are modelled by returning an event from the interaction. Failure mitigation In case of technical failures, baker offers two mitigation strategies: Retry with incremental back-off This retries the interaction with some configurable parameters: initialTimeout : The initial delay for the first retry. backoffFactor : The back-off factor. maximumInterval : The maximum interval between retries. Continue with an event. This is analagous to a try/catch in Java code. The exception is logged but the process continues with a specified event. The interaction gets blocked when no failure strategy is defined for it. Event An event has a name and can (optionally) provide ingredients. The purpose of events is therefore twofold. It signifies that something of interest has happened for a recipe instance . Example, \"the customer placed the order\" , \"terms and conditions were accepted\" The event may provide ingredients required to continue the process. Example, \"OrderPlaced\" - list of products We distinguish two conceptual types of events. Sensory events ( external ) These events are provided from outside of the process. Interaction output ( internal ) These events are a result of an interaction being executed. Both of these are still just instances of the EventInstance class, and the distinction is only used as practical terms. Recipe Events , Interactions and Ingredients can be composed into recipes. Recipes are similar to process blueprints. Baker provides a recipe DSL in which you can declaratively describe your recipe. A small example: new Recipe ( webshop ) . withSensoryEvents ( OrderPlaced . class , CustomerInfoReceived . class . withInteractions ( of ( ValidateOrder . class ), of ( ManufactureGoods . class )); The main take away is that when declaring your recipe you do not have to think about order.

The general steps in the development lifecycle are: 1) Design a Recipe: In Baker you are always required to make a distinction between specification (Recipe) and implementation (Runtime) of your business process, you will use the Recipe DSL to express the interface of ingredients and events (data) and interactions (actions), which will help Baker understand your orchestration flow. Baker recipes are the interface of your business process, they specify Baker Types without values for Ingredients and Events, and specify input Ingredients and output Events without implementation for Interactions. 2) Use Visualizations: Baker is able to create a graphical representation of your recipe, this becomes very useful for reasoning about your business process, and easily communicate and discuss about it. 3) Implement Interactions: To execute the orchestration plan specified by the recipe, you must create interaction implementations, which are the code blocks that match the interfaces of the ingredient/event/interactions. These must be registered to baker, which will imply their correspondence with the recipe by matching the interfaces. 4) Create Process Instances, Fire Events and Inquiry: After registering recipes and implementations, you are able to create instances of the recipes, which execute after you fire events, which will execute calls to your microservices. The state of a given process may be requested at any time for application utility. 5) Test: Common methods of testing are, independently test each implementation, running a process instance and then inspect the current state, and running a process instance using mocked implementations. 6) Configure: There are several parts of Baker that can be configured, including but not limited to: event store connection, clustering, etc. 7) Deploy: Baker has a cluster mode, which must be deployed with a certain order or by configuring service discovery. 8) Monitor: Baker provides event listeners, which will allow you to monitor the process instances. 9) Resolve Failed Processes:","title":"Development Life Cycle"},{"location":"sections/development-life-cycle/#development-life-cycle","text":"In this section we will explain every step in the process of developing business functionality across your microservices using Baker, we will focus on practical aspects: how to do things and why you should do them.

For this example we are going to create an Akka-based, non-cluster, local runtime. This runtime is based on a library called Akka which helps us manage concurrency and gives us distributed-systems semantics for the cluster mode, this is almost completely hidden from you, but currently for some configuration and managing a Baker cluster, it might be useful to check the Akka documentation. Also note that to add a Recipe you need to first transform it into a CompiledRecipe by using the provided RecipeCompiler.compileRecipe(recipe) API. Note: Since Baker 3.0 all APIs of the runtime are asynchronous by default. That means all APIs return Future[A] for Scala (IO interface will come in the future depending on demand) and CompletableFuture A for Java. If you are not familiar with these constructs we highly recommend checking one of the many tutorials and documentation pages in the internet, otherwise for now you can do .join on any CompletableFuture or Await.result(yourFuture, 1.second) on any Future to block and do normal synchronous/blocking programming.

RecipeInstances can be created by choosing a CompiledRecipe by using the recipeId yielded by the Baker.addRecipe(compiledRecipe) API, and by providing a recipeInstanceId of your choosing; you will use this last id to reference and interact with the created RecipeInstance . Use the Baker.bake(recipeId, recipeInstanceId) API for creating a RecipeInstance . Note: In an Akka-cluster-based Baker, these RecipeInstances are also automatically distributed over nodes, and the cluster will ensure that there is 1 RecipeInstance running on 1 node, and if the node dies, it will detect it and restore the RecipeInstance in another available node, for this you need to configure an underlying distributed store; for more on this please refer to the configuration section and the runtime section .

There are several supported semantics for firing an event. When you fire an event you might want to be notified and continue your asynchronous computation on 1 of 4 different moments: When the event got accepted by the RecipeInstance but has not started cascading the execution of InteractionInstances . For this use the Baker.fireEventAndResolveWhenReceived(recipeInstanceId, eventInstance) API. This will return a Future[SensoryEventStatus] enum notifying of the outcome (the event might get rejected). When the event got accepted by the RecipeInstance and has finished cascading the execution of InteractionInstances up to the point that it requires more EventInstances ( SensoryEvents ) to continue, or the process has finished. For this use the Baker.fireEventAndResolveWhenCompleted(recipeInstanceId, eventInstance) API. This will return a Future[EventResult] object containing a SensoryEventStatus , the Event names that got fired in consequence of this SensoryEvent , and the current available Ingredients output of the InteractionInstances that got executed as consequence of the SensoryEvent . You want to do something on both of the previously mentioned moments, then use the Baker.fireEvent(recipeInstanceId, eventInstance) API, which will return an EventResolutions object which contains both Future[SensoryEventStatus] and Future[EventResult] (or its CompletableFuture A equivalents in Java). As soon as an intermediate Event fires from one of the InteractionInstances that execute as consequence of the fired SensoryEvent . For this use the Baker.fireEventAndResolveOnEvent(recipeInstanceId, eventInstance, onEventName) API. This will return a similar Future[EventResult to the one returned by Baker.fireEventAndResolveWhenCompleted except the data will be up to the moment the onEventName was fired.

The Development Life Cycle section provides a \"top-down\"/\"by-example\" guide to baker, all of the concepts are introduced through exemplification on hypothetical development situations. Modeling the order placement process for a webshop using Ingredients, Events and Recipes. The recipe DSL allows you to declaratively describe your business process. The design always starts with the business requirements, lets say you are developing a webshop which will have many different microservices on the backend. The initial requirements for the order reservation process reads: \"An order contains an order id and a list of store item identifiers, when an order is placed it must first be validated by reserving the items from the warehouse service, a success scenario yields the ids of the reserved items, but if at least one item is unavailable at the warehouse a failure yields the list of unavailable items and the process stops\" When developing with Baker we must first translate the requirements into our 3 essential building blocks, Ingredients for raw data, Events for happenings (that might contain ingredients), and Interactions which have ingredients as input, execute actions with other systems, and yield more events. We will do this so that the baker runtime can orchestrate the execution of our process through the underlying microservices. Ingredients and Events A recipe always starts with initial events, also called Sensory Events , in the case of our first requirement we could model the placing of an order as an event, which will provide 2 ingredients: the order id and the list of items. Scala import com.ing.baker.recipe.scaladsl._ object Ingredients { val OrderId : Ingredient [ String ] = Ingredient [ String ]( orderId ) val Items : Ingredient [ List [ String ]] = Ingredient [ List [ String ]]( items ) } object Events { val OrderPlaced : Event = Event ( name = OrderPlaced , providedIngredients = Seq ( Ingredients . OrderId , Ingredients . Items ), maxFiringLimit = Some ( 1 ) ) } Java // In Java the data structures to represent Events and Ingredients // will be extraxted from a class by the reflection API when building // the Recipe. (see below for full example) public class JWebshopRecipe { public static class OrderPlaced { public final String orderId ; public final List String items ; public OrderPlaced ( String orderId , List String items ) { this . orderId = orderId ; this . items = items ; } } } Depending on your programming language, you might want to import the corresponding dsl, i.e. scaladsl vs javadsl . Ingredients and events are just data structures that describe your process data, carrying not just the names, but also the type information, for example Ingredient[String](\"order-id\") creates an ingredient of name \"order-id\" of type \"String\", for more information about Baker types please refer to this section . As shown in the code, events might carry ingredients, and have a maximum about of times they are allowed to fire, the runtime will enforce this limit. For more information about this and other features of events please refer to this section . Interactions Then, the desired actions can be modeled as interactions , in our case we are told that it exists a warehouse service which we need to call to reserve the items, but this might either succeed or fail. Note: Notice that when using the reflection API, the Java interface or Scala trait that will represent your interaction must have a method named apply , this is the method that the reflection API will convert into Baker types/ingredients/events. Scala object Interactions { val ReserveItems : Interaction = Interaction ( name = ReserveItems , inputIngredients = Seq ( Ingredients . OrderId , Ingredients . Items , ), output = Seq ( Events . OrderHadMissingItems , Events . ItemsReserved ) ) } object Ingredients { // ... previous ingredients val ReservedItems : Ingredient [ List [ String ]] = Ingredient [ List [ String ]]( reservedItems ) val UnavailableItems : Ingredient [ List [ String ]] = Ingredient [ List [ String ]]( unavailableItems ) } object Events { // ... previous events val OrderHadUnavailableItems : Event = Event ( name = OrderHadUnavailableItems , providedIngredients = Seq ( Ingredients . UnavailableItems ), maxFiringLimit = Some ( 1 ) ) val ItemsReserved : Event = Event ( name = ItemsReserved , providedIngredients = Seq ( Ingredients . ReservedItems ), maxFiringLimit = Some ( 1 ) ) } Java (Reflection API) public class JWebshopRecipe { // ... previous event // Interface that will represent our Interaction, notice that it is declaring inner events. public interface ReserveItems extends Interaction { interface ReserveItemsOutcome { } class OrderHadUnavailableItems implements ReserveItemsOutcome { public final List String unavailableItems ; public OrderHadUnavailableItems ( List String unavailableItems ) { this . unavailableItems = unavailableItems ; } } class ItemsReserved implements ReserveItemsOutcome { public final List String reservedItems ; public ItemsReserved ( List String reservedItems ) { this . reservedItems = reservedItems ; } } // The @FireEvent annotation communicates the reflection API about several possible outcome events. @FiresEvent ( oneOf = { OrderHadUnavailableItems . class , ItemsReserved . class }) // The @RequiresIngredient annotation communicates the reflection API about the ingredient names that other events // must provide to execute this interaction. // The method MUST be named `apply` ReserveItemsOutcome apply ( @RequiresIngredient ( orderId ) String id , @RequiresIngredient ( items ) List String items ); } } An interaction resembles a function, it takes input ingredients and outputs 1 of several possible events. At runtime, when an event fires, baker tries to match the provided ingredients of 1 or several events to the input of awaiting interactions, as soon as there is a match on data, baker will execute the interactions, creating a cascading effect that will execute your business process in an asynchronous manner. This was a simple example, but you might have already concluded that this can be further composed into bigger processes by making new interactions that require events and ingredients which are output of previous interactions. You can create also interactions which take no input ingredients but are executed after events (with or without provided ingredients) are fired, for this and other features please refer to the conceptual documentation found here . The Recipe The final step is to create an object that will hold all of these descriptions into what we call a Recipe, this becomes the \"blueprint\" of your process, it can define failure handling strategies, and will \"auto-bind\" the interactions, that means it detects the composition between interactions by matching the ingredients provided by events to the input ingredients required by interactions.

As you might have realised Ingredients , Events and Interactions could be reused on different Recipes, giving common business verbs that your programs and organisation can use across teams, the same way different cooking recipes share same processes (simmering, boiling, cutting) you should reuse interactions across your different business recipes. As a bonus; you might have though that this API is verbose, we agree and that is why we developed an alternative API which uses Java and Scala reflection.

Errors are thrown in the form of exceptions describing the issue. So a simple unit test that simply compiles your Recipe is essential. Scala class WebshopRecipeSpec extends FlatSpec with Matchers { The WebshopRecipe should compile the recipe without errors in { RecipeCompiler . compileRecipe ( WebshopRecipe . recipe ) } } Java public class JWebshopRecipeTests { @Test public void shouldCompileTheRecipeWithoutIssues () { RecipeCompiler . compileRecipe ( JWebshopRecipe . recipe ); } } Testing Recipes for Correctness: Mocking Interaction Implementations The next layer is to test that the Recipe actually does what you expect it to do at the business logic level independently of the underlying implementations. One way of doing so is by providing InteractionImplementations that behave as expected according to a testing scenario. On the next example we will: Create a new local instance of baker. Setup mocked interaction instances that behave according to your desired test scenario. Wire the recipe and implementations to fire sensory events according to your desired test scenario. Inspect the recipe instance state. Assert expectations on the state and/or the sensory event results. Note: Take into consideration the asynchronous nature of Baker, some times the easiest is to use fireAndResolveWhenCompleted that will resolve when a sensory event has completely finished affecting the state of the recipe instance. Scala /** Interface used to mock the ReserveItems interaction using the reflection API. */ trait ReserveItems { def apply ( orderId : String , items : List [ String ]) : Future [ WebshopRecipeReflection.ReserveItemsOutput ] } /** Mock of the ReserveItems interaction. */ class ReserveItemsMock extends ReserveItems { override def apply ( orderId : String , items : List [ String ]) : Future [ WebshopRecipeReflection.ReserveItemsOutput ] = Future . successful ( WebshopRecipeReflection . ItemsReserved ( items )) } The Webshop Recipe should reserve items in happy conditions in { val system : ActorSystem = ActorSystem ( baker-webshop-system ) val materializer : Materializer = ActorMaterializer ()( system ) val baker : Baker = Baker . akkaLocalDefault ( system , materializer ) val compiled = RecipeCompiler . compileRecipe ( WebshopRecipe . recipe ) val recipeInstanceId : String = UUID . randomUUID (). toString val orderId : String = order-id val items : List [ String ] = List ( item1 , item2 ) val orderPlaced = EventInstance . unsafeFrom ( WebshopRecipeReflection .

ReserveItems { @Override public ReserveItemsOutcome apply ( String id , List String items ) { return new ItemsReserved ( items ); } } @Test public void shouldRunSimpleInstance () { ActorSystem actorSystem = ActorSystem . create ( WebshopSystem ); Materializer materializer = ActorMaterializer . create ( actorSystem ); Baker baker = Baker . akkaLocalDefault ( actorSystem , materializer ); List String items = new ArrayList ( 2 ); items . add ( item1 ); items . add ( item2 ); EventInstance firstOrderPlaced = EventInstance . from ( new JWebshopRecipe . OrderPlaced ( order-uuid , items )); EventInstance paymentMade = EventInstance . from ( new JWebshopRecipe . PaymentMade ()); InteractionInstance reserveItemsInstance = InteractionInstance . from ( new HappyFlowReserveItems ()); CompiledRecipe compiledRecipe = RecipeCompiler . compileRecipe ( JWebshopRecipe . recipe ); String recipeInstanceId = first-instance-id ; CompletableFuture List String result = baker . addInteractionInstace ( reserveItemsInstance ) . thenCompose ( ignore - baker . addRecipe ( compiledRecipe )) . thenCompose ( recipeId - baker . bake ( recipeId , recipeInstanceId )) . thenCompose ( ignore - baker . fireEventAndResolveWhenCompleted ( recipeInstanceId , firstOrderPlaced )) . thenCompose ( ignore - baker . fireEventAndResolveWhenCompleted ( recipeInstanceId , paymentMade )) . thenCompose ( ignore - baker . getRecipeInstanceState ( recipeInstanceId )) . thenApply ( x - x . events (). stream (). map ( EventMoment :: getName ). collect ( Collectors . toList ())); List String blockedResult = result . join (); assert ( blockedResult . contains ( OrderPlaced ) blockedResult . contains ( PaymentMade ) blockedResult . contains ( ItemsReserved )); } This test is replicating a full round through a Recipe , the only difference with your normal production code is that InteractionInstances are adapted to fit the scenario you want to check, so the objective here is to test that the Recipe ends on the desired state given a certain order of firing sensory events and that the interaction instances return the specific data. Note: We recommend you abstract away these scenarios with a function that will run them given different interaction instances, so that you can run the same scenario on different environments, like when you want to do a E2E on a test environment. Mocking Interaction Implementations with Mockito Baker supports InteractionInstances that are mockito mocks, this will give you the added semantics of Mockito, like verifying that the interaction instance was called, or even called with the expected data. Scala trait ReserveItems { def apply ( orderId : String , items : List [ String ]) : Future [ WebshopRecipeReflection.ReserveItemsOutput ] } The Webshop Recipe should reserve items in happy conditions (mockito) in { val system : ActorSystem = ActorSystem ( baker-webshop-system ) val materializer : Materializer = ActorMaterializer ()( system ) val baker : Baker = Baker . akkaLocalDefault ( system , materializer ) val compiled = RecipeCompiler . compileRecipe ( WebshopRecipe . recipe ) val recipeInstanceId : String = UUID . randomUUID (). toString val orderId : String = order-id val items : List [ String ] = List ( item1 , item2 ) val orderPlaced = EventInstance . unsafeFrom ( WebshopRecipeReflection .

For example: Scala case class CustomerInfoReceived ( customerInfo : CustomerInfo ) Java public class CustomerInfoReceived { public final CustomerInfo customerInfo ; public CustomerInfoReceived ( CustomerInfo customerInfo ) { this . customerInfo = customerInfo ; } } The field types of the POJO class must be compatible with the baker type system. See the supported types for more information. The names of the fields are obtained using reflection. They can be added using the .withSensoryEvents(..) method. Firing limit A firing limit is a limit on the number of times a sensory event may be received by a recipe instance . By default sensory events have a firing limit of 1 per process instance. This means the event will be rejected with status FiringLimitMet after the first time it is received. If you want to send an event more then once you may add it like this: . withSensoryEventsNoFiringLimit ( CustomerInfoReceived . class ) In this example the CustomerInfoReceived can now be received multiple times by a process instance. Interactions Interactions are interfaces with some requirements. See here how to define them. You can include interactions in your recipe using the static of(..) method. import static com.ing.baker.recipe.javadsl.InteractionDescriptor.of ; final Recipe webshopRecipe = new Recipe ( webshop ) . withInteractions ( of ( ValidateOrder . class ) ) There are a number of options to tailor an interaction for your recipe. Maximum interaction count By default there is no limit on the number of times an Interaction may fire. Sometimes you may want to set a limit. For example, to ensure the goods are shipped only once. . withInteractions ( of ( ShipGoods . class ). withMaximumInteractionCount ( 1 ) ) Predefining ingredients An interaction normally requires all its input ingredients to be provided from Events . Sometimes however it is useful to predefine (or hard code ) the value of an ingredient. For example: An email template An application/requester id when calling an external system This can be done by: . withInteractions ( of ( SendEmail . class ) . withPredefinedIngredient ( emailTemplate , Welcome to ING! ) ) Note that predefined ingredients are always available and do not have to be provided by an event for each interaction call. Each time all remaining ingredients are provided, the interaction will fire. You can not predefine ALL input ingredients of an interaction. Event renames Sometimes it useful to rename an interaction event and/or its ingredients to fit better in the context of your recipe. For example, to rename the GoodsManufactured event and its ingredient. . withInteractions ( of ( ManufactureGoods . class ) . withEventTransformation ( GoodsManufactured . class , ManufacturingDone , ImmutableMap . of ( goods , manufacturedGoods ) ) ) ) Event requirements As mentioned before, the DSL is declarative, you do not have to think about order. This is implicit in the data requirements of the interactions. However, sometimes data requirements are not enough. For example, you might want to be sure to only send an invoice ( SendInvoice ) AFTER the goods where shipped ( GoodsShipped ). of ( SendInvoice . class ) . withRequiredEvents ( ShipGoods . GoodsShipped . class ) In this case the GoodsShipped event MUST happen before the interaction may execute. You can specify multiple events in a single clause. These are bundled with an AND condition, meaning ALL events in the clause are required. You can also require a single event from a number of options. of ( SendInvoice . class ) . withRequiredOneOfEvents ( EventA . class , EventB . class ) In this case the interaction may fire if either EventA OR EventB has occured. Interaction Failure strategy When an interaction throws an exception there are a number of mitigation strategies: Block interaction This is the DEFAULT strategy if no other is defined and no default strategy is defined. This option is suitable for non idempotent interactions that cannot be retried. When an exception is thrown from the interaction the interaction is blocked . This means that the interaction cannot execute again automatically. It requires manual intervening to continue the process from then on. Fire event This option is analagous to a try { } catch { } in code. When an exception is raised from the interaction you specify an event to fire. So instead of failing the process continues. Example: . withInteractions ( of ( ValidateOrder . class ) . withInteractionFailureStrategy ( InteractionFailureStrategy . FireEvent ( ValidateOrderFailed ) ) ) Retry with incremental backoff Incremental backoff allows you to configure a retry mechanism that takes longer for each retry. The idea here is that you quickly retry at first but slower over time. To not overload your system but give it time to recover. . withInteractions ( of ( ValidateOrder . class ) . withFailureStrategy ( new RetryWithIncrementalBackoffBuilder () . withInitialDelay ( Duration . ofMillis ( 100 )) . withBackoffFactor ( 2.0 ) . withMaxTimeBetweenRetries ( Duration . ofSeconds ( 100 )) . withDeadline ( Duration . ofHours ( 24 )) . build ()) ) What do these parameters mean? name meaning initialDelay The delay for the first retry. backoffFactor The backoff factor for the delay (optional, default = 2 ) maxTimeBetweenRetries The maximum interval between retries. deadLine The maximum total amount of time spend delaying. For our example this results in the following delay pattern: 100 millis - 200 millis - 400 millis - ... - 100 seconds - 100 seconds Which can be visualized like this: Note that these delays do not include interaction execution time. For example, if the first retry execution takes 5 seconds (and fails again) then the second retry will be triggered after (from the start): (100 millis + 5 seconds + 200 millis) = 5.3 seconds This also means that the 24 hour deadline does not include interaction execution time. It is advisable to take this into account when coming up with this number. Retry exhaustion It can happen that after some time, when an interaction keeps failing, that the retry is exhausted. When this happens 2 things may happen. Either the interaction becomes [blocked(#blocked-interaction). Or if you configure so, the process continues with a predefined event: .withFailureStrategy ( new RetryWithIncrementalBackoffBuilder () .withFireRetryExhaustedEvent ( SomeEvent.class )) Note that this event class requires an empty constructor to be present and cannot provide ingredients. Default failure strategy You can also define a default failure strategy on the recipe level. This then serves as a fallback if none is defined for an interaction. For example: final Recipe webshopRecipe = new Recipe ( webshop ) . withDefaultFailureStrategy ( new RetryWithIncrementalBackoffBuilder () . withInitialDelay ( Duration . ofMillis ( 100 )) . withDeadline ( Duration . ofHours ( 24 )) . withMaxTimeBetweenRetries ( Duration . ofMinutes ( 10 )) . build ());","title":"Recipe DSLs"},{"location":"sections/reference/dsls/#recipe-dsls","text":"Conceptually a Recipe allows you to declaratively describe your business process and is a \"blueprint\" that can be used to start a RecipeInstance on the runtime.

Note: Ingredients are indirectly added to the Recipe because they come inside Events .

Baker tries to match the currently available provided IngredientInstances with the input of awaiting InteractionInstances . InteractionInstances that can be called, execute and when complete they fire more EventInstances , repeating the loop from step 1. This continues until there are no more InteractionInstances to execute, and the process is considered complete. Notes A sensory event may be provided 1 or more times depending on its firing limit .

Because tokens can only be consumed by one transition we have to add a layer to duplicate the token for all transitions. Interaction with precondition (AND) By default event preconditions use an AND combinator. In the petri net this means that each event transition has to produce a token in a place for that interaction. Interaction with precondition (OR) Events that are grouped in an OR combinator for an interaction output a token to the same place.

Scala val baker : Baker = Baker . akkaLocalDefault ( actorSystem , materializer ) Java Baker baker = Baker . akkaLocalDefault ( actorSystem , materializer ); Advantages of the Cluster Mode The capabilities gained when in cluster mode are: Elasticity: by adding/removing nodes to the cluster. Resilience: RecipeInstances are automatically restored in a new node when the hosting node fails. (For this you need to configure a distributed data store like Cassandra) Routing: You can fire EventInstances from anywhere on the cluster, and Baker will ensure that the corresponding RecipeInstance receives the firing event. Note: To run on cluster mode you need to configure a distributed data store, we highly recommend using Cassandra. InteractionInstance.from(object) (Reflection API) As part of our efforts to ease the creation of InteractionInstances we created this function that uses the Scala and the Java reflection capabilities to create an InteractionInstance from an instance of a class. The name of the InteractionInstance will be taken from the name of the implementing interface (Java) or trait (Scala) (it must match the name of the Interaction at the Recipe ). The interface MUST declare a public method called apply , and the types must match those of the expected provided ingredients.

This can be done using the baker.addInteractionInstance(interactionInstance) or the baker.addInteractionInstances(intance1, instance2, ...) APIs. Note: in Java the api returns a CompletableFuture BoxedUnit , this is because the API is implemented in Scala, so Scala's Unit get translated to BoxedUnit , but you should you ignore it and consider it as good as Java's void , except it comes in a CompletableFuture that will help you handle async programming.

These can be used to create a new RecipeInstance from a baker runtime that contains both a CompiledRecipe and the required InteractionInstances , or they can as well be converted into a visualziation . Scala import com.ing.baker.compiler.RecipeCompiler import com.ing.baker.il.CompiledRecipe val compiledRecipe : CompiledRecipe = RecipeCompiler . compileRecipe ( recipe ) Java import com.ing.baker.compiler.RecipeCompiler ; import com.ing.baker.il.CompiledRecipe ; CompiledRecipe compiledRecipe = RecipeCompiler . compileRecipe ( recipe ); baker.addRecipe(compiledRecipe) Once Recipes have been transformed into CompiledRecipes they must be added to a baker runtime. The baker.addRecipe(compiledRecipe) API will do so and return an id that you can use to reference the added recipe later on. Note: Before doing this, baker requires you to add all related InteractionInstances to the runtime, this is because baker does validation to ensure that every recipe is runnable from the previously added InteractionInstances . Scala val recipeId Future [ String ] = baker . addRecipe ( compiledRecipe ) Java CompletableFuture String recipeId = baker . addRecipe ( compiledRecipe ); baker.getAllRecipes() The baker at runtime can give you a map of all the currently available recipes that has been previously added to Baker.

Note: This API requires you to choose a recipeInstanceId , the API does not provide one for you, this is so that you can manage this reference as required. Note: in Java the api returns a CompletableFuture BoxedUnit , this is because the API is implemented in Scala, so Scala's Unit get translated to BoxedUnit , but you should you ignore it and consider it as good as Java's void , except it comes in a CompletableFuture that will help you handle async programming.

The name of the EventInstance will be taken from the name of the class (Java) or case class (Scala) (it must match the name of the Event at the Recipe ). And the argument names and types of the constructors will be translated to IngredientInstances with corresponding names and baker types. Notice that this function might throw an exception if the event is not correctly done (this is why in Scala the API is named \"unsafe\"). Scala import com.ing.baker.runtime.scaladsl.EventInstance case class OrderPlaced ( orderId : String , items : List [ String ]) val firstOrderPlaced : EventInstance = EventInstance . unsafeFrom ( OrderPlaced ( order-id , List ( item1 , item2 ))) Java import com.ing.baker.runtime.javadsl.EventInstance ; class OrderPlaced { String orderId ; List String items ; public OrderPlaced ( String orderId , List String items ) { this . orderId = orderId ; this . items = items ; } } EventInstance firstOrderPlaced = EventInstance . from ( new JWebshopRecipe . OrderPlaced ( order-uuid , items )); baker.fireEvent(recipeInstanceId, eventInstance) After creation of a RecipeInstance , you use one of the variations of baker.fireEvent(recipeInstanceId, eventInstance) to fire your EventInstances and start/continue the process flow. There are several supported semantics for firing an event which depend on the moment you want to get notified and continue your asynchronous computation, these are the 4 different moments: When the event got accepted by the RecipeInstance but has not started cascading the execution of InteractionInstances . For this use the Baker.fireEventAndResolveWhenReceived(recipeInstanceId, eventInstance) API. This will return a Future[SensoryEventStatus] enum notifying of the outcome (the event might get rejected). When the event got accepted by the RecipeInstance and has finished cascading the execution of InteractionInstances up to the point that it requires more EventInstances ( SensoryEvents ) to continue, or the process has finished. For this use the Baker.fireEventAndResolveWhenCompleted(recipeInstanceId, eventInstance) API. This will return a Future[EventResult] object containing a SensoryEventStatus , the Event names that got fired in consequence of this SensoryEvent , and the current available Ingredients output of the InteractionInstances that got executed as consequence of the SensoryEvent . You want to do something on both of the previously mentioned moments, then use the Baker.fireEvent(recipeInstanceId, eventInstance) API, which will return an EventResolutions object which contains both Future[SensoryEventStatus] and Future[EventResult] (or its CompletableFuture A equivalents in Java). As soon as an intermediate Event fires from one of the InteractionInstances that execute as consequence of the fired SensoryEvent . For this use the Baker.fireEventAndResolveOnEvent(recipeInstanceId, eventInstance, onEventName) API. This will return a similar Future[EventResult to the one returned by Baker.fireEventAndResolveWhenCompleted except the data will be up to the moment the onEventName was fired. correlationId Optionally you may provide a correlation id when firing a EventInstance . The purpose of this identifier is idempotent event delivery: when sending the same event correlation id multiple times, only the first will be processed. This can be applied to the OrderPlaced event for example. Scala val correlationOrderId = a unique order id for { statusA - baker . processEventAndResolveWhenReceived ( recipeInstanceId , orderPlacedEvent , correlationOrderId ) _ = assert ( statusA == Received ) statusB - baker . processEventAndResolveWhenReceived ( recipeInstanceId , orderPlacedEvent , correlationOrderId ) _ = assert ( statusB == AlreadyReceived ) } yield () Java String correlationOrderId = a unique order id ; SensoryEventStatus statusA = baker . processEventAndResolveWhenReceived ( recipeInstanceId , orderPlacedEvent , correlationOrderId ); . join (); assert ( statusA == Received ); SensoryEventStatus statusB = baker . processEventAndResolveWhenReceived ( recipeInstanceId , orderPlacedEvent , correlationOrderId ); . join (); assert ( statusB == AlreadyReceived ); SensoryEventStatus Status Description Received The event was received normally AlreadyReceived An event with the same correlation id was already received ProcessDeleted The process instance was deleted ReceivePeriodExpired The receive period for the process instance has passed FiringLimitMet The firing limit for the event was met baker.getRecipeInstanceState(recipeInstanceId) baker.getInteractionInstanceState(recipeInstanceId) will return an InteractionInstanceState object which contains all the event names with timestamps that have executed, and the current available provided ingredient data. Scala import com.ing.baker.runtime.scaladsl.RecipeInstanceState val state : Future [ RecipeInstanceState ] = baker . getRecipeInstanceState ( recipeInstanceId ) Java import com.ing.baker.runtime.javadsl.RecipeInstanceState ; CompletableFuture RecipeInstanceState state = baker . getRecipeInstanceState ( recipeInstanceId ); baker.getAllInteractionInstancesMetadata() Returns the recipeId, recipeInstanceId and creation timestamp of all running RecipeInstances . Note: Can potentially return a partial result when baker runs in cluster mode because not all shards might be reached within the given timeout. Note: Does not include deleted RecipeInstances . baker.getVisualState(recipeInstanceId, style) Another method of fetching state is the visual representation of it. You can do that with the Baker.getVisualState(recipeInstanceId) API. This will return a GraphViz string like the visualization api that you can convert into an image. Here is a visualization of the state of another webshop example, one can clearly see that the process is flowing correctly without failures and that it is still waiting for the payment sensory event to be fired. Scala val state : Future [ String ] = baker . getVisualState ( recipeInstanceId ) Java CompletableFuture String state = baker . getVisualState ( recipeInstanceId ); baker.registerEventListener(recipeName, listenerFunction) Registers a listener to all runtime events for this baker instance. Note that: - The delivery guarantee is AT MOST ONCE . Practically this means you can miss events when the application terminates (unexpected or not). - The delivery is local (JVM) only, you will NOT receive events from other nodes when running in cluster mode. Because of these constraints you should not use an event listener for critical functionality. Valid use cases might be: - logging - metrics - unit tests Scala baker . registerEventListener (( recipeInstanceId : String , event : EventInstance ) = { println ( s Recipe instance : $recipeInstanceId processed event ${ event . name } ) }) Java BiConsumer String , EventInstance handler = ( String recipeInstanceId , EventInstance event ) - System . out . println ( Recipe Instance + recipeInstanceId + processed event + event . name ()); baker . registerEventListener ( handler ); baker.registerBakerEventListener(listenerFunction) Registers a listener to all runtime BAKER events, these are events that notify what Baker is doing, like RecipeInstances received EventInstances or CompiledRecipes being added to baker. Note that: - The delivery guarantee is AT MOST ONCE . Practically this means you can miss events when the application terminates (unexpected or not). - The delivery is local (JVM) only, you will NOT receive events from other nodes when running in cluster mode.

At this point it is possible to resolve the blocked interaction in 2 ways. This one involves forcing another try, resulting either on a successful continued process, or again on a failed state, to check this you will need to request the state of the RecipeInstance again. Note: this behaviour can be automatically preconfigured by using the RetryWithIncrementalBackoff FailureStrategy on the Interaction of the Recipe Scala val program : Future [ Unit ] = baker . retryInteraction ( recipeInstanceId , ReserveItems ) Java CompletableFuture BoxedUnit program = baker . retryInteraction ( recipeInstanceId , ReserveItems ); baker.resolveInteraction(recipeInstanceId, interactionName, event) It is possible that during the execution of a RecipeInstance it becomes blocked , this can happen either because it is directly blocked by an exception or that the retry strategy was exhausted. At this point it is possible to resolve the blocked interaction in two ways.
