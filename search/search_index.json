With these three components we can create recipes (process blue prints) Ingredient Ingredients are pure data . This data is immutable , can not be changed after entering the process. There is no hierarchy in this data. ( Animal - Dog - Labrador is not possible to express) Examples: an IBAN a track and trace code a list of phone numbers a customer information object with name, email, etc ... An ingredient is defined by a name and type . The name points to the intended meaning of the data. (\"customerData\", \"orderNumber\", ...) The type sets limits on the form of data that is accepted. (a number, a list of strings, ...) This type is expressed by the baker type system . Interaction An interaction is analagous to a function. It requires input ( ingredients ) and provides output ( events ). Within this contract it may do anything. For example: query an external system put a message on a bus generate a document or image extract or compose ingredients into others When finished, an interaction provides an event as its output. Interaction failure An interaction may fail to fulfill its intended purpose. We distinquish 2 types of failures. A technical failure is one that could be retried and succeed. For example: Time outs because of unreliable network, packet loss External system is temporarily down or unresponsive External system returned a malformed/unexpected response These failures are unexpected and are are modeled by throwing an exception from the interaction. A functional failure is one that cannot be retried. For example: The customer is too young for the request. Not enough credit to perform the transfer. These failures are expected possible outcomes of the interaction. They are modelled by returning an event from the interaction. Failure mitigation In case of technical failures, baker offers 2 mitigation strategies: Retry with incremental backoff This retries the interaction with some configurable parameters: initialTimeout : The initial delay for the first retry. backoffFactor : The backoff factor. maximumInterval : The maximum interval between retries. Continue with an event. This is analagous to a try/catch in java code. The exception is logged but the process continues with a specified event. When no failure strategy is defined for an interaction by default the interaction is blocked . Event An event has a name and can (optionally) provide ingredients. The purpose of events is therefor twofold. It signifies something of interest happened for a process instance . Example, \"the customer placed the order\" , \"terms and conditions where accepted\" The event may provide ingredients required to continue the process. Example, \"OrderPlaced\" - list of products We distinquish 2 types of events. Sensory events ( external ) These events are provided from outside of the process. Interaction output ( internal ) These events are a result of an interaction being executed. Recipe Events , Interactions and Ingredients can be composed into recipes. Recipes are analagous to process blueprints. Baker provides a Recipe DSL in which you can declaritively describe your recipe. A small example: new Recipe ( webshop ) . withSensoryEvents ( OrderPlaced . class , CustomerInfoReceived . class . withInteractions ( of ( ValidateOrder . class ), of ( ManufactureGoods . class )); The main take away is that when declaring your recipe you do not have to think about order.

Translation rules The compiler has some rules about translating recipe parts to transitions and places in the petri net. Ingredient used by multiple interactions Often an ingredient will be used by multiple interactions in a recipe. Because tokens can only be consumed by 1 transition we have to add a layer to duplicate the token for all transitions. Interaction with precondition (AND) By default event preconditions use an AND combinator. In the petri net this means that each event transition has to produce a token in a place for that interaction. Interaction with precodition (OR) Events that are grouped in an OR combinator for an interaction output a token to the same place.

Scala // Assuming you have a compiled recipe val recipe : CompiledRecipe = ??? // A unique identifier ment to distinguish this process from other process instances val processId = a-unique-process-id // Tell Baker that we want to create a new process for a certain recipe. baker . bake ( recipe . recipeId , processId ) Java // Assuming you have a compiled recipe CompiledRecipe recipe = null ; // // A unique identifier ment to distinguish this process from other process instances String processId = a-unique-process-id ; // Tell Baker that we want to create a new process for a certain recipe. baker . bake ( recipe . recipeId (), processId ); Providing a sensory event In our webshop example the first events that can happen are OrderPlaced , PaymentMade and CustomerInfoReceived . These are so called sensory events since they are not the result of an interaction but must be provided by the user of Baker. Scala // The CustomerInfoReceived and OrderPlaced events require some data (Ingredients) val customerInfo = CustomerInfo ( John , Elm. Street , johndoe@example.com ) val order = 123 ; // Lets produce the `OrderPlaced` and `CustomerInfoReceived` sensory Events. baker . processEvent ( processId , CustomerInfoRecived ( customerInfo )) baker . processEvent ( processId , OrderPlaced ( order )) Java // The CustomerInfoReceived and OrderPlaced events require some data (Ingredients) CustomerInfo customerInfo = new CustomerInfo ( John , Elm. Street , johndoe@example.com ); String order = 123 ; // Lets produce the `OrderPlaced` and `CustomerInfoReceived` sensory Events. baker . processEvent ( processId , new CustomerInfoReceived ( customerInfo )); baker . processEvent ( processId , new OrderPlaced ( order )); When receiving events Baker will check which Interactions have all the required Ingredients and Events met. It will execute those interactions. Those interactions will raise more events. For more information about the exact execution sementics see here . Correlation id Optionally you may provide a correlation id with an event. The purpose of this identifier is idempotent event delivery. When sending the same event correlation id multiple times, only the first will be processed. This can be applied to the OrderPlaced event for example. Scala val orderId = a unique order id val statusA : SensoryEventStatus = baker . processEvent ( processId , new OrderPlaced ( order ), orderId ) val statusB : SensoryEventStatus = baker . processEvent ( processId , new OrderPlaced ( order ), orderId ) // statusA == Received // statusB == AlreadyReceived Java String orderId = a unique order id ; SensoryEventStatus statusA = baker . processEvent ( processId , new OrderPlaced ( order ), orderId ); SensoryEventStatus statusB = baker . processEvent ( processId , new OrderPlaced ( order ), orderId ); // statusA == Received // statusB == AlreadyReceived Sensory event status In response to recieving a sensory event baker returns a status code indicating how it processed it. Status Description Received The event was received normally AlreadyReceived An event with the same correlation id was already received ProcessDeleted The process instance was deleted ReceivePeriodExpired The receive period for the process instance has passed FiringLimitMet The firing limit for the event was met Incident resolving It is possible that during execution a process instance becomes blocked . This can happen either because it is directly blocked by a exception or that the retry strategy was exhuasted. At this point it is possible to resolve the blocked interaction in 2 ways. 1. Force retry For example, the retry strategy for \"SendInvoice\" was exhausted after a few hours of retrying. However, we checked and know the \"invoice\" service is up again and want to continue to process for our customer. Scala baker . retryInteraction ( processId , SendInvoice ) Java baker . retryInteraction ( processId , SendInvoice ); 2. Specify the interaction output For example, the \"ShipGoods\" backend service is not idempotent and failed with an exception. It is not retried but blocked . However, we checked and know the goods were actually shipped and want to continue the process for our customer. Scala baker . resolveInteraction ( processId , ShipGoods , GoodsShipped ( some goods )) Java baker . resolveInteraction ( processId , ShipGoods , new GoodsShipped ( some goods )); Note that the event provided SHOULD NOT include any event or ingredient renames specified for the interaction. State inquiry During runtime it is often useful to inquire on the state of a process instance. Visualize process instance state We can use the visualizer to see what Baker has done with the given events. Scala val dotRepresentation : String = baker . getVisualState ( processId ) Java String dotRepresentation = baker . getVisualState ( processId ); Did you know?! You can ask baker for a visual representation of a certain process. That way you can see which Events where provided and which Interaction are ran. See the visualization page how to create a visual graph. The image shows us that the ValidateOrder Interaction is colored green which means that the Interaction has been exucuted. Baker was able to exeucte the Interaction because all required Events and Ingredients where provided. The ValidateOrder Interaction in turn produced the Valid event. We can also see that the ManufactureGoods Interaction is still purple, meaning that it has not been executed. This is correct because ManufactureGoods requires an additional event called PaymentMade . Events We can ask Baker for a list of all the events for our process. Using this list we can check if the InvoiceWasSend event was produced. Scala // Get all events that have happend for this process instance val events : Seq [ RuntimeEvent ] = baker . getEvents ( processId ) if ( events . exists ( _ . name == InvoiceWasSend )) // Yes the invoice was send! Java // Get all events that have happend for this process instance EventList events = baker . getEvents ( processId ); if ( events . hasEventOccurred ( InvoiceWasSend . class )) // Yes the invoice was send! Ingredients Sometimes it is useful to know what the ingredient values are accumulated for a process instance. For example, you might want to know the value of the trackingId . Scala // Get all ingredients that are accumulated for a process instance val ingredients : Map [ String , Value ] = baker . getIngredients ( processId ) val trackingId : String = ingredients ( trackingId ). as [ String ] Java // Get all ingredients that are accumulated for a process instance Map String , Value ingredients = baker . getIngredients ( processId ); String trackingId = ingredients . get ( trackingId ). as ( String . class );","title":"Process Execution"},{"location":"documentation/process-execution/#process-execution","text":"","title":"Process Execution"},{"location":"documentation/process-execution/#recap","text":"On the runtime page we discussed how you could could initialize Baker and add your recipe to it.

Let's start with the web shop recipe as an example. The complete code example can be found here . final Recipe webshopRecipe = new Recipe ( webshop ) . withSensoryEvents ( OrderPlaced . class , CustomerInfoReceived . class , PaymentMade . class ) . withInteractions ( of ( ValidateOrder . class ), of ( ManufactureGoods . class ) . withRequiredEvents ( PaymentMade . class , ValidateOrder . Valid . class ), of ( SendInvoice . class ) . withRequiredEvents ( ShipGoods . GoodsShipped . class ), of ( ShipGoods . class )) . withDefaultFailureStrategy ( new RetryWithIncrementalBackoffBuilder () . withInitialDelay ( Duration . ofMillis ( 100 )) . withDeadline ( Duration . ofHours ( 24 )) . withMaxTimeBetweenRetries ( Duration . ofMinutes ( 10 )) . build ()); Sensory events Events are simple POJO classes. For example: Scala case class CustomerInfoReceived ( customerInfo : CustomerInfo ) Java public class CustomerInfoReceived { public final CustomerInfo customerInfo ; public CustomerInfoReceived ( CustomerInfo customerInfo ) { this . customerInfo = customerInfo ; } } The field types of the POJO class must be compatible with the baker type system. See the supported types for more information. The names of the fields are obtained using java reflection. They can be added using the .withSensoryEvents(..) method. Firing limit A firing limit is a limit on the number of times a sensory event may be received by a process instance . By default sensory events have a firing limit of 1 per process instance. This means the event will be rejected with status FiringLimitMet after the first time it is received. If you want to send an event more then once you may add it like this: . withSensoryEventsNoFiringLimit ( CustomerInfoReceived . class ) In this example the CustomerInfoReceived can now be received multiple times by a process instance. Interactions Interactions are interfaces with some requirements. See here how to define them. You can include interactions in your recipe using the static of(..) method. import static com.ing.baker.recipe.javadsl.InteractionDescriptor.of ; final Recipe webshopRecipe = new Recipe ( webshop ) . withInteractions ( of ( ValidateOrder . class ) ) There are a number of options to tailor an interaction for your recipe. Maximum interaction count By default there is no limit on the number of times an Interaction may fire. Sometimes you may want to set a limit. For example, to ensure the goods are shipped only once. . withInteractions ( of ( ShipGoods . class ). withMaximumInteractionCount ( 1 ) ) Predefining ingredients An interaction normally requires all its input ingredients to be provided from Events . Sometimes however it is useful to predefine (or hard code ) the value of an ingredient. For example: An email template An application/requester id when calling an external system This can be done by: . withInteractions ( of ( SendEmail . class ) . withPredefinedIngredient ( emailTemplate , Welcome to ING! ) ) Note that predefined ingredients are always available and do not have to be provided by an event for each interaction call. Each time all remaining ingredients are provided, the interaction will fire. You can not predefine ALL input ingredients of an interaction. Event renames Sometimes it useful to rename an interaction event and/or its ingredients to fit better in the context of your recipe. For example, to rename the GoodsManufactured event and its ingredient. . withInteractions ( of ( ManufactureGoods . class ) . withEventTransformation ( GoodsManufactured . class , ManufacturingDone , ImmutableMap . of ( goods , manufacturedGoods ) ) ) ) Event requirements As mentioned before, the DSL is declarative, you do not have to think about order. This is implicit in the data requirements of the interactions. However, sometimes data requirements are not enough. For example, you might want to be sure to only send an invoice ( SendInvoice ) AFTER the goods where shipped ( GoodsShipped ). of ( SendInvoice . class ) . withRequiredEvents ( ShipGoods . GoodsShipped . class ) In this case the GoodsShipped event MUST happen before the interaction may execute. You can specify multiple events in a single clause. These are bundled with an AND condition, meaning ALL events in the clause are required. You can also require a single event from a number of options. of ( SendInvoice . class ) . withRequiredOneOfEvents ( EventA . class , EventB . class ) In this case the interaction may fire if either EventA OR EventB has occured. Interaction Failure strategy When an interaction throws an exception there are a number of mitigation strategies: Block interaction This is the DEFAULT strategy if no other is defined and no default strategy is defined. This option is suitable for non idempotent interactions that cannot be retried. When an exception is thrown from the interaction the interaction is blocked . This means that the interaction cannot execute again automatically. It requires manual intervening to continue the process from then on. Fire event This option is analagous to a try { } catch { } in code. When an exception is raised from the interaction you specify an event to fire. So instead of failing the process continues. Example: . withInteractions ( of ( ValidateOrder . class ) . withInteractionFailureStrategy ( InteractionFailureStrategy . FireEvent ( ValidateOrderFailed ) ) ) Retry with incremental backoff Incremental backoff allows you to configure a retry mechanism that takes longer for each retry. The idea here is that you quickly retry at first but slower over time. To not overload your system but give it time to recover. . withInteractions ( of ( ValidateOrder . class ) . withFailureStrategy ( new RetryWithIncrementalBackoffBuilder () . withInitialDelay ( Duration . ofMillis ( 100 )) . withBackoffFactor ( 2.0 ) . withMaxTimeBetweenRetries ( Duration . ofSeconds ( 100 )) . withDeadline ( Duration . ofHours ( 24 )) . build ()) ) What do these parameters mean? name meaning initialDelay The delay for the first retry. backoffFactor The backoff factor for the delay (optional, default = 2 ) maxTimeBetweenRetries The maximum interval between retries. deadLine The maximum total amount of time spend delaying. For our example this results in the following delay pattern: 100 millis - 200 millis - 400 millis - ... - 100 seconds - 100 seconds Which can be visualized like this: Note that these delays do not include interaction execution time. For example, if the first retry execution takes 5 seconds (and fails again) then the second retry will be triggered after (from the start): (100 millis + 5 seconds + 200 millis) = 5.3 seconds This also means that the 24 hour deadline does not include interaction execution time. It is advisable to take this into account when coming up with this number. Retry exhaustion It can happen that after some time, when an interaction keeps failing, that the retry is exhausted. When this happens 2 things may happen. Either the interaction becomes [blocked(#blocked-interaction). Or if you configure so, the process continues with a predefined event: .withFailureStrategy ( new RetryWithIncrementalBackoffBuilder () .withFireRetryExhaustedEvent ( SomeEvent.class )) Note that this event class requires an empty constructor to be present and cannot provide ingredients. Default failure strategy You can also define a default failure strategy on the recipe level. This then serves as a fallback if none is defined for an interaction. For example: final Recipe webshopRecipe = new Recipe ( webshop ) . withDefaultFailureStrategy ( new RetryWithIncrementalBackoffBuilder () . withInitialDelay ( Duration . ofMillis ( 100 )) . withDeadline ( Duration . ofHours ( 24 )) . withMaxTimeBetweenRetries ( Duration . ofMinutes ( 10 )) . build ());","title":"Recipe DSL"},{"location":"documentation/recipe-dsl/#recipe-dsl","text":"The recipe DSL allows you to declaritively describe your process.

If your Baker application is using local actors, thus not using akka cluster, a Split Brain Resolver is not needed. Baker library, when configured to be a cluster, runs in an akka cluster to distribute the baker processes over multiple nodes. Running a cluster with multiple nodes with shared state has some difficulties to tackle in some network failure scenarios, like network partitions. When there's a network partition in a cluster, the nodes at the different sides of the partition cannot receive messages from each other and eventually diverge their states unless it is a network hick-up. When this happens, you need a mechanism to prevent state inconsistency, i.e. by stopping nodes at one side of the partition, so the nodes at the surviving side still run with consistent states. A Split Brain Resolver algorithm for Akka prevents inconsistent states during network partitions, or huge network delays, or non-responding cluster members. Baker Split Brain Resolver is a general purpose implementation for Akka which could be configured for a baker cluster as well as for another akka cluster without baker. Strategies The current version of the Split Brain Resolver algorithm supports only the Majority strategy which makes the majority of the nodes survive and downs (terminates) the nodes at the minority side of the network partition. In case of the number of nodes on each side of the network partition are equal, the side with the oldest akka node survives. By deciding to down one side, you do not end up with 2 akka clusters during the network partition. There could be other strategies implemented later, for now the Majority strategy works for most of the use cases. You can read about other possible strategies supported by the commercial Lightbend Split Brain Resolver here . Majority strategy is configured by default, so you do not need extra configuration for this. How to use In order to use Baker SplitBrainResolver , first of all, you need to add baker-split-brain-resolver dependency to your project. See example below: Sbt libraryDependencies += com.ing.baker %% baker-split-brain-resolver % 2.0.3 Maven dependency groupId com.ing.baker /groupId artifactId baker-split-brain-resolver_2.12 /artifactId version 2.0.3 /version /dependency Then the algorithm needs to be configured as the akka downing provider and the stable-after config needs to set to some duration depending on your cluster size. stable-after config is needed to decide on how quickly to react on the akka cluster state changes. Very short durations may allow quicker 'downing' decisions for unreachable nodes, but may also cause to down some nodes unnecessarily too early. Please see the suggested values for this in the documentation of the commercial Lightbend Split Brain Resolver. One other akka cluster configuration suggested keep in sync with stable-after is the akka.cluster.down-removal-margin config. The suggested values and more information on this config can be found in the Cluster Singleton and Cluster Sharding section of the commercial Lightbend Split Brain Resolver. Example config for a baker cluster having less than 10 nodes is the following: akka.cluster.down-removal-margin = 7 seconds akka.cluster.downing-provider-class = com.ing.baker.runtime.actor.downing.SplitBrainResolver baker-split-brain-resolver { stable-after = 7 seconds }","title":"Split Brain Resolver"},{"location":"documentation/split-brain-resolver/#split-brain-resolver","text":"","title":"Split Brain Resolver"},{"location":"documentation/split-brain-resolver/#description","text":"Note: This feature is applicable to clustered baker configuration.
