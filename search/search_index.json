Many engineering teams have identified Microservices as an important component of this architectural approach to designing more flexible systems that can meet the needs of their fast changing businesses. Applying this approach however, is hard. And ideas and practices are still very much evolving. To help with that, we've launched muCon - a conference to learn about emerging technologies and approaches, share challenges and evolve practices and ideas.   Their applications are built on top of microservices. If there careful enough their application serve bad meals.   If we are building microservices or a monolith or any type of service in general we are serving business logic to our clients. So no matter what we can not escape the architectural discussion.\nIf we are not careful of how we architect our applications we end up serving bad meals.   I love cooking food  and for the rest of the talk I'll be using analogies from there. It's very  similar to our industry : long hours, hard work, and delivering experiences to our customers.  Have you been woken up at 3 o'clock in the morning on a  Saturday morning  after a night of partying, having to go to the war room and resolve an application incident. I've been there. When I remember the cold of the  airconditioners , it still  makes me shiver .
