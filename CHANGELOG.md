# Changelog

## 1.0.1
- Fixed a bug in the runtime that it could not bind an ingredient multiple times as parameter for an interaction
- Removed the JCompiledRecipe and moved the functionality to the CompiledRecipe
- Added a validation to the java Recipe that @sFiresEvent and @ProvidesIngredient are not used at the same time.

## 1.0.0
- baker modules are reorganized to support mode modularity and loose coupling
- created separate modules: compiler, intermediate-language, recipe-dsl, runtime
- design time and runtime parts of baker are now separate and ideally could be updated independently

## 0.2.19
- enabled kryo serialization for all baker events that extend from com.ing.baker.api.Event interface
- disabled default Java serialization
- IMPORTANT: It is mandatory to extend/implement com.ing.baker.api.Event interface in your event classes. Kryo serialization understands plain pojo classes, so you may continue using lombok annotations
- IMPORTANT: It is mandatory to extend/implement com.ing.baker.api.Ingredient interface in your custom Ingredient data types. Kryo serialization understands all standard Java/Scala data types + guava + jodatime types.

## 0.2.16
- clients of baker can use protocol buffers serialized events with a proper protobuf configuration 
- bug fix in the passivation logic

## 0.2.15
- bug fix for the actor passivation logic

## 0.2.14
- bug fixes related to akka sharding

## 0.2.13
- Baker can now persist encrypted ingredients if enabled. This feature is disabled by default.
  
  To enable encryption you need to have the following two settings in your application.conf file.
  ```
  baker.encryption.enabled = on
  baker.encryption.secret = someStrongSecretText
  ```

## 0.2.6
- Now allow the adding of Events that have no ingredients nor have any preconditions.
  For these events a dummy ingredient is created to allow it to be added to the petri net.
  This dummy ingredient is filtered out during visualisation of the recipe.

## 0.2.5
- Fixed a bug in visualisation of a recipe that had max interaction count.

## 0.2.4
- JBaker now expects a List\<Interaction\> instead of List\<JInteraction\>
- Sieves do not need to have a implementation added anymore
- Added a check to the recipe compilation to check if a Sieves have a default constructor

## 0.2.3
- Allowed changing the Interaction name in the JInteractionDescriptor
- By changing a interaction name now multiple of the same interaction are allowed in a recipe

## 0.2.2
- Baker and JBaker now expect a List\<JInteraction\> instead of a List\<Object\> for the implementations
